### Line 1 ###
ï»¿Well, my dad was a farmer.

### Line 2 ###
Um, like everybody else back then.

### Line 3 ###
Of course, he didn't start that way.

### Line 4 ###
Computer says you're too tight.

### Line 5 ###
- Nah, I got this.

### Line 6 ###
- Crossing the Straights.

### Line 7 ###
- Shutting it down, Cooper.

### Line 8 ###
- No!

### Line 9 ###
- Shutting it all down.

### Line 10 ###
- No, I need power up!

### Line 11 ###
Dad?

### Line 12 ###
Sorry, Murph. Go back to bed.

### Line 13 ###
- I thought you were the ghost.

### Line 14 ###
- No.

### Line 15 ###
There are no such things as ghosts, babe.

### Line 16 ###
Grandpa says you can get ghosts.

### Line 17 ###
Maybe that's because Grandpa's close

### Line 18 ###
to being one himself. Back to bed.

### Line 19 ###
Were you dreaming about the crash?

### Line 20 ###
Get your butt back in bed, Murph. Heh.

### Line 21 ###
The wheat had died.

### Line 22 ###
The blight came and we had to burn it.

### Line 23 ###
And we still had corn.

### Line 24 ###
We had acres of corn.

### Line 25 ###
But, uh, mostly we had dust.

### Line 26 ###
I guess I can't describe it.

### Line 27 ###
It was just constant.

### Line 28 ###
Just that steady blow...

### Line 29 ###
of dirt.

### Line 30 ###
We wore, um, little strips of sheet...

### Line 31 ###
sometimes over our nose and mouth...

### Line 32 ###
so that we wouldn't

### Line 33 ###
breathe so much of it.

### Line 34 ###
When we set the table,

### Line 35 ###
we always set the plate...

### Line 36 ###
upside-down.

### Line 37 ###
Glasses or cups, whatever it was...

### Line 38 ###
upside-down.

### Line 39 ###
Shake a leg! Murph, get a move on!

### Line 40 ###
Tom, 4:00 today, you and me in the barn,

### Line 41 ###
Herbicide Resistance 101.

### Line 42 ###
- Check?

### Line 43 ###
- Yes, sir.

### Line 44 ###
Not at the table, Murph.

### Line 45 ###
Dad, can you fix this?

### Line 46 ###
What the heck did you do...

### Line 47 ###
- to my lander?

### Line 48 ###
- Wasn't me.

### Line 49 ###
Let me guess. It was your ghost?

### Line 50 ###
It knocked it off.

### Line 51 ###
It keeps knocking books off.

### Line 52 ###
No such thing as ghosts, dumb-ass.

### Line 53 ###
Hey.

### Line 54 ###
I looked it up. It's

### Line 55 ###
called a poltergeist.

### Line 56 ###
Dad, tell her.

### Line 57 ###
Well, it's not very scientific, Murph.

### Line 58 ###
You said science was about admitting

### Line 59 ###
what we don't know.

### Line 60 ###
- She's got you there.

### Line 61 ###
- Hey.

### Line 62 ###
Start looking after our stuff.

### Line 63 ###
Coop.

### Line 64 ###
All right, Murph, you want to talk science?

### Line 65 ###
Don't tell me you're afraid of some ghost.

### Line 66 ###
No, you got to go further.

### Line 67 ###
You got to record the facts, analyse,

### Line 68 ###
get to the how and the why...

### Line 69 ###
then present your conclusions. Deal?

### Line 70 ###
- Deal.

### Line 71 ###
- All right.

### Line 72 ###
- Have a good day at school.

### Line 73 ###
- Hold up.

### Line 74 ###
Parent-teacher conferences. Parent.

### Line 75 ###
Not grandparent.

### Line 76 ###
Slow down, turbo!

### Line 77 ###
- That's not a dust storm.

### Line 78 ###
- Nelson's torching his whole crop.

### Line 79 ###
Blight?

### Line 80 ###
They're saying it's

### Line 81 ###
the last harvest for okra.

### Line 82 ###
Ever.

### Line 83 ###
He should've planted corn

### Line 84 ###
like the rest of us.

### Line 85 ###
Now, be nice to that Miss Hanley.

### Line 86 ###
She's single.

### Line 87 ###
What's that supposed to mean?

### Line 88 ###
Repopulating the earth.

### Line 89 ###
Start pulling your weight, young man.

### Line 90 ###
Why don't you start

### Line 91 ###
minding your own business, old man?

### Line 92 ###
All right, Murph, give me second.

### Line 93 ###
Uh-huh.

### Line 94 ###
Third.

### Line 95 ###
- Find a gear, dumb-ass.

### Line 96 ###
- Grind it!

### Line 97 ###
Shut it, Tom!

### Line 98 ###
- What'd you do, Murph?

### Line 99 ###
- Ah, she didn't do nothing.

### Line 100 ###
- Blew a tire is all.

### Line 101 ###
- Murphy's Law.

### Line 102 ###
Shut up!

### Line 103 ###
- Grab the spare, Tom.

### Line 104 ###
- That is the spare.

### Line 105 ###
Get the patch kit!

### Line 106 ###
How am I supposed to patch it out here?

### Line 107 ###
You got to figure it out.

### Line 108 ###
I'm not always gonna be here to help you.

### Line 109 ###
What's going on, Murph?

### Line 110 ###
Why did you and Mom name me

### Line 111 ###
after something that's bad?

### Line 112 ###
We didn't.

### Line 113 ###
Murphy's Law?

### Line 114 ###
Murphy's Law doesn't mean

### Line 115 ###
that something bad will happen.

### Line 116 ###
What it means is

### Line 117 ###
whatever can happen will happen.

### Line 118 ###
And that sounded just fine with us.

### Line 119 ###
Whoa!

### Line 120 ###
Get in.

### Line 121 ###
Get in, let's go.

### Line 122 ###
What about the flat tire?

### Line 123 ###
Yeah.

### Line 124 ###
It's an Indian Air Force drone.

### Line 125 ###
Solar cells could power an entire farm.

### Line 126 ###
Take the wheel, Tom.

### Line 127 ###
Go, go, go!

### Line 128 ###
Keep that aimed right at it.

### Line 129 ###
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

### Line 130 ###
Right at it.

### Line 131 ###
Stay on it.

### Line 132 ###
Here we go.

### Line 133 ###
Whoa.

### Line 134 ###
Nice one, Tom.

### Line 135 ###
Dad?

### Line 136 ###
I almost got it. Don't stop. Don't stop!

### Line 137 ###
Dad!

### Line 138 ###
Tom!

### Line 139 ###
You told me to keep driving.

### Line 140 ###
Well, I guess that answers the old "if I

### Line 141 ###
asked you to drive off a cliff" scenario.

### Line 142 ###
- We lost it.

### Line 143 ###
- No, we didn't.

### Line 144 ###
Want to give it a whirl?

### Line 145 ###
This way.

### Line 146 ###
Go.

### Line 147 ###
Let's lay her down right there

### Line 148 ###
at the edge of the reservoir.

### Line 149 ###
Nicely done.

### Line 150 ###
How long you think it's been up there?

### Line 151 ###
Delhi Mission Control went down,

### Line 152 ###
same as ours...

### Line 153 ###
- ten years ago.

### Line 154 ###
- Heh.

### Line 155 ###
So for ten years?

### Line 156 ###
- Why did it come down so low?

### Line 157 ###
- I don't know.

### Line 158 ###
Maybe the sun cooked its brain

### Line 159 ###
or it was looking for something.

### Line 160 ###
- What?

### Line 161 ###
- Give me a large flat-blade.

### Line 162 ###
Maybe some kind of signal? I don't know.

### Line 163 ###
What are you gonna do with it?

### Line 164 ###
I'm gonna give it something

### Line 165 ###
socially responsible to do...

### Line 166 ###
like drive a combine.

### Line 167 ###
Can't we just let it go?

### Line 168 ###
It wasn't hurting anybody.

### Line 169 ###
This thing needs to learn

### Line 170 ###
how to adapt, Murph...

### Line 171 ###
like the rest of us.

### Line 172 ###
How's this work?

### Line 173 ###
You guys come with?

### Line 174 ###
I've got class.

### Line 175 ###
This one needs to wait.

### Line 176 ###
- What did you do?

### Line 177 ###
- They'll tell you about it in there.

### Line 178 ###
- Am I gonna be mad?

### Line 179 ###
- Not with me.

### Line 180 ###
- Just please try not to.

### Line 181 ###
- Hey. Relax.

### Line 182 ###
I got this.

### Line 183 ###
Little late, Coop.

### Line 184 ###
Yeah, we had a flat.

### Line 185 ###
And I guess you had to stop off

### Line 186 ###
at the Asian fighter plane store.

### Line 187 ###
No, actually, sir, that's

### Line 188 ###
a surveillance drone.

### Line 189 ###
With outstanding solar cells. It's Indian.

### Line 190 ###
Take a seat.

### Line 191 ###
So, uh...

### Line 192 ###
we got Tom's scores back.

### Line 193 ###
He's going to make an excellent farmer.

### Line 194 ###
Yeah, he's got a knack for it.

### Line 195 ###
What about college?

### Line 196 ###
The university only takes a handful.

### Line 197 ###
They don't have the resources to...

### Line 198 ###
I still pay my taxes.

### Line 199 ###
Where's that money go?

### Line 200 ###
There's no more armies.

### Line 201 ###
Well, it doesn't go to the university.

### Line 202 ###
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

### Line 203 ###
You're ruling my son out for college now?

### Line 204 ###
- The kid's 15.

### Line 205 ###
- Tom's score simply isn't high enough.

### Line 206 ###
What's your waistline? About what, 32?

### Line 207 ###
About a 33 inseam?

### Line 208 ###
I'm not sure I see

### Line 209 ###
what you're getting at.

### Line 210 ###
It takes two numbers to measure your ass

### Line 211 ###
but only one to measure my son's future?

### Line 212 ###
Come on. You're a well-educated man, Coop.

### Line 213 ###
- And a trained pilot.

### Line 214 ###
- And an engineer.

### Line 215 ###
Okay, well, right now

### Line 216 ###
we don't need more engineers.

### Line 217 ###
We didn't run out of television screens

### Line 218 ###
and planes. We ran out of food.

### Line 219 ###
The world needs farmers.

### Line 220 ###
Good farmers, like you.

### Line 221 ###
- And Tom.

### Line 222 ###
- Uneducated farmers.

### Line 223 ###
We're a caretaker generation, Coop.

### Line 224 ###
And things are getting better.

### Line 225 ###
Maybe your grandkids

### Line 226 ###
will get to be engin...

### Line 227 ###
Are we done here, sir?

### Line 228 ###
No.

### Line 229 ###
Miss Hanley's here to talk about Murph.

### Line 230 ###
Murph is a great kid. She's really bright.

### Line 231 ###
But she's been having a

### Line 232 ###
little trouble lately.

### Line 233 ###
She brought this in to show the students.

### Line 234 ###
The section on the lunar landings.

### Line 235 ###
Yeah, it's one of my old textbooks.

### Line 236 ###
She always loved the pictures.

### Line 237 ###
It's an old federal textbook. We've

### Line 238 ###
replaced them with the corrected versions.

### Line 239 ###
Corrected?

### Line 240 ###
Explaining how the Apollo missions were

### Line 241 ###
faked to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

### Line 242 ###
You don't believe we went to the moon?

### Line 243 ###
It was a brilliant piece of propaganda.

### Line 244 ###
The Soviets bankrupted themselves

### Line 245 ###
pouring resources...

### Line 246 ###
into rockets and other useless machines.

### Line 247 ###
"Useless machines."

### Line 248 ###
If we don't want a repeat of the excess and

### Line 249 ###
wastefulness of the 20th century, then...

### Line 250 ###
we need to teach our kids about

### Line 251 ###
this planet, not tales of leaving it.

### Line 252 ###
One of those useless machines

### Line 253 ###
they used to make was called an MRI.

### Line 254 ###
If we had any of those left,

### Line 255 ###
the doctors would've been able to find...

### Line 256 ###
the cyst in my wife's brain

### Line 257 ###
before she died instead of afterwards.

### Line 258 ###
Then she'd have been the one

### Line 259 ###
listening to this instead of me...

### Line 260 ###
which would have been a good thing,

### Line 261 ###
because she was always...

### Line 262 ###
the calmer one.

### Line 263 ###
I'm sorry about your wife, Mr. Cooper.

### Line 264 ###
But Murph got into a fistfight

### Line 265 ###
with several of her classmates over this...

### Line 266 ###
Apollo nonsense.

### Line 267 ###
So we thought it best

### Line 268 ###
to bring you in and see what ideas...

### Line 269 ###
you might have for dealing

### Line 270 ###
with her behaviour on the home front.

### Line 271 ###
Yeah, you know what?

### Line 272 ###
Um, there's a game tomorrow night.

### Line 273 ###
She's going through a bit

### Line 274 ###
of a baseball phase.

### Line 275 ###
Her favourite team is playing.

### Line 276 ###
There's gonna be candy and soda and...

### Line 277 ###
I think I'll take her to that.

### Line 278 ###
How'd it go?

### Line 279 ###
I got you suspended.

### Line 280 ###
- What?

### Line 281 ###
- Cooper.

### Line 282 ###
This is Cooper. Go.

### Line 283 ###
Coop, those combines you rebuilt

### Line 284 ###
went haywire.

### Line 285 ###
Just reset the controllers.

### Line 286 ###
I did that. Now you

### Line 287 ###
should come take a look.

### Line 288 ###
One by one they've been

### Line 289 ###
peeling off the fields and heading over.

### Line 290 ###
Something's interfering with the compass.

### Line 291 ###
Magnetism or some such.

### Line 292 ###
Nothing special about which book.

### Line 293 ###
I've been working on it, like you said.

### Line 294 ###
- I counted the spaces.

### Line 295 ###
- Why?

### Line 296 ###
In case the ghost is trying to communicate.

### Line 297 ###
I'm trying Morse.

### Line 298 ###
Morse?

### Line 299 ###
Yeah.

### Line 300 ###
- Dots and dashes, used...

### Line 301 ###
- I know what Morse code is, Murph.

### Line 302 ###
I just don't think

### Line 303 ###
your bookshelf's trying to talk to you.

### Line 304 ###
Had to reset every compass clock and GPS

### Line 305 ###
to offset for the anomaly.

### Line 306 ###
- Which is?

### Line 307 ###
- I don't know.

### Line 308 ###
If the house was built on magnetic ore...

### Line 309 ###
we'd have seen this the first time

### Line 310 ###
we switched on the tractor.

### Line 311 ###
I hear your meeting at the school

### Line 312 ###
didn't go so well.

### Line 313 ###
Heh. You heard?

### Line 314 ###
It's like we've forgotten

### Line 315 ###
who we are, Donald.

### Line 316 ###
Explorers, pioneers, not caretakers.

### Line 317 ###
When I was a kid...

### Line 318 ###
it felt like they made something new

### Line 319 ###
every day. Some...

### Line 320 ###
gadget or idea.

### Line 321 ###
Like every day was Christmas.

### Line 322 ###
But six billion people...

### Line 323 ###
just try to imagine that.

### Line 324 ###
And every last one of them

### Line 325 ###
trying to have it all.

### Line 326 ###
This world isn't so bad.

### Line 327 ###
And Tom will do just fine.

### Line 328 ###
You're the one who doesn't belong. Born

### Line 329 ###
My daughter knew it, God bless her.

### Line 330 ###
And your kids know it. Especially Murph.

### Line 331 ###
Well, we used to look up in the sky

### Line 332 ###
and wonder...

### Line 333 ###
at our place in the stars.

### Line 334 ###
Now we just look down and worry

### Line 335 ###
about our place in the dirt.

### Line 336 ###
Cooper, you were good at something...

### Line 337 ###
and you never got a chance

### Line 338 ###
to do anything with it.

### Line 339 ###
I'm sorry.

### Line 340 ###
You didn't expect...

### Line 341 ###
this dirt that was

### Line 342 ###
giving you this food...

### Line 343 ###
to turn on you like

### Line 344 ###
that and destroy you.

### Line 345 ###
In April... I believe I'm right...

### Line 346 ###
Fifteenth of April, I think.

### Line 347 ###
This happened about 1:30 when that thing...

### Line 348 ###
came off the top of that canyon.

### Line 349 ###
In my day, we had real ballplayers.

### Line 350 ###
Who are these bums?

### Line 351 ###
In my day, people were too busy...

### Line 352 ###
fighting over food

### Line 353 ###
to even play baseball.

### Line 354 ###
Popcorn at a ballgame is unnatural.

### Line 355 ###
I want a hot dog.

### Line 356 ###
School says you're gonna follow

### Line 357 ###
in my footsteps.

### Line 358 ###
I think that's great.

### Line 359 ###
- You think that's great?

### Line 360 ###
- You hate farming, Dad.

### Line 361 ###
Grandpa said.

### Line 362 ###
Grandpa said, huh?

### Line 363 ###
Listen, all that matters

### Line 364 ###
is how you feel about it.

### Line 365 ###
I like what you do.

### Line 366 ###
I like our farm.

### Line 367 ###
You're gonna be great at it.

### Line 368 ###
Let's get out of here.

### Line 369 ###
All right, it's a doozy.

### Line 370 ###
All right, gang, let's mask up.

### Line 371 ###
- Tom? Murph? Check?

### Line 372 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 373 ###
Murph, Tom, you guys shut your windows?

### Line 374 ###
Murph?

### Line 375 ###
The ghost.

### Line 376 ###
Grab your pillow.

### Line 377 ###
You're sleeping in with Tom.

### Line 378 ###
It's not a ghost.

### Line 379 ###
It's gravity.

### Line 380 ###
I'm dropping Tom, then heading to town.

### Line 381 ###
You want to clean that up

### Line 382 ###
when you've finished praying to it?

### Line 383 ###
It's not Morse, Murph. It's binary.

### Line 384 ###
Thick is one, thin is zero.

### Line 385 ###
Coordinates.

### Line 386 ###
Nope. Mm-mm.

### Line 387 ###
Here we go.

### Line 388 ###
Thirty-three.

### Line 389 ###
That's it.

### Line 390 ###
I can't miss this!

### Line 391 ###
Grandpa will be back in

### Line 392 ###
a couple hours, Murph.

### Line 393 ###
But you don't know what you're gonna find.

### Line 394 ###
And that...

### Line 395 ###
is why I can't take you.

### Line 396 ###
Murph?

### Line 397 ###
Grandpa will be home in a while.

### Line 398 ###
Tell him I'll call him on the radio.

### Line 399 ###
- Aah!

### Line 400 ###
- Jesus.

### Line 401 ###
- What are you doing?

### Line 402 ###
- Heh-heh.

### Line 403 ###
Oh, you think this is funny? Huh?

### Line 404 ###
You wouldn't be here if it wasn't for me.

### Line 405 ###
Make yourself useful.

### Line 406 ###
Hey, Murph?

### Line 407 ###
Murph!

### Line 408 ###
I think this is the end of the road.

### Line 409 ###
Didn't you bring the bolt cutters?

### Line 410 ###
That's my girl.

### Line 411 ###
Step away!

### Line 412 ###
Don't shoot! I'm not armed.

### Line 413 ###
My daughter's in the car.

### Line 414 ###
- Don't be afraid.

### Line 415 ###
- Aah!

### Line 416 ###
How did you find this place?

### Line 417 ###
Where's my daughter?

### Line 418 ###
You had the coordinates for this facility

### Line 419 ###
marked on your map. Where did you get them?

### Line 420 ###
Where's my daughter?

### Line 421 ###
Don't make me take you down again.

### Line 422 ###
Sit down!

### Line 423 ###
Oh, you still think you're a Marine, pal?

### Line 424 ###
Marines don't exist anymore.

### Line 425 ###
And I got grunts like

### Line 426 ###
you mowing my grass.

### Line 427 ###
Where did you find

### Line 428 ###
those coordinates?

### Line 429 ###
But you don't look much like a lawnmower.

### Line 430 ###
Think I'll turn you

### Line 431 ###
into an overqualified vacuum cleaner.

### Line 432 ###
No, you won't.

### Line 433 ###
TARS, back down, please.

### Line 434 ###
You know, you're taking a risk

### Line 435 ###
using ex-military security.

### Line 436 ###
They're old, and their control units

### Line 437 ###
are unpredictable.

### Line 438 ###
It's what the government could spare.

### Line 439 ###
Who are you?

### Line 440 ###
Dr. Brand.

### Line 441 ###
I knew a Dr. Brand once.

### Line 442 ###
He was a professor.

### Line 443 ###
What makes you think I'm not?

### Line 444 ###
Wasn't near as cute, either.

### Line 445 ###
Please, Dr. Brand.

### Line 446 ###
I don't have any idea what this is.

### Line 447 ###
Now I'm scared for my daughter

### Line 448 ###
and want her by my side.

### Line 449 ###
You give me that,

### Line 450 ###
I'll tell you anything you want to know.

### Line 451 ###
Get the principals and the girl

### Line 452 ###
in the conference room, please.

### Line 453 ###
Your daughter is fine.

### Line 454 ###
Bright kid.

### Line 455 ###
Must have a very smart mother.

### Line 456 ###
It's pretty clear you

### Line 457 ###
don't want any visitors.

### Line 458 ###
So why don't you just let us back up from

### Line 459 ###
your fence and we'll be on our way? Huh?

### Line 460 ###
- It's not that simple.

### Line 461 ###
- Well, sure, it is.

### Line 462 ###
I don't know anything about you.

### Line 463 ###
I don't know anything about this place.

### Line 464 ###
Yes, you do.

### Line 465 ###
Dad!

### Line 466 ###
Hello, Cooper.

### Line 467 ###
Professor Brand.

### Line 468 ###
Explain to me how you found this facility.

### Line 469 ###
Kind of an accident. We sort of stumbled

### Line 470 ###
upon it. We were on a salvage run...

### Line 471 ###
You're sitting in the best-kept secret

### Line 472 ###
in the world.

### Line 473 ###
Nobody stumbles in here.

### Line 474 ###
Nobody stumbles out.

### Line 475 ###
Cooper, please.

### Line 476 ###
Cooperate with these people.

### Line 477 ###
Look.

### Line 478 ###
It's kind of hard to explain.

### Line 479 ###
We learned these coordinates

### Line 480 ###
from an anomaly.

### Line 481 ###
What sort of anomaly?

### Line 482 ###
I hesitate to term it supernatural,

### Line 483 ###
but it definitely wasn't scientific.

### Line 484 ###
You're going to have to be specific,

### Line 485 ###
Mr. Cooper. Right now.

### Line 486 ###
It was gravity.

### Line 487 ###
Um, what sort of gravitational anomaly?

### Line 488 ###
Where was this?

### Line 489 ###
Now, I'm real happy that you're excited

### Line 490 ###
about gravity, bud...

### Line 491 ###
but you're not getting any answers

### Line 492 ###
from us until I get assurances.

### Line 493 ###
- Assurances?

### Line 494 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 495 ###
Like, that we're getting out of here.

### Line 496 ###
And I don't mean in the trunk of some car.

### Line 497 ###
Don't you know who we are, Coop?

### Line 498 ###
No, professor, I don't.

### Line 499 ###
You know my father, Professor Brand.

### Line 500 ###
We're NASA.

### Line 501 ###
- NASA?

### Line 502 ###
- NASA.

### Line 503 ###
The same NASA you flew for.

### Line 504 ###
I heard they shut you down, sir...

### Line 505 ###
for refusing to drop bombs

### Line 506 ###
from the stratosphere...

### Line 507 ###
onto starving people.

### Line 508 ###
When they realised

### Line 509 ###
that killing other people was...

### Line 510 ###
not a long-term solution,

### Line 511 ###
then they needed us back.

### Line 512 ###
- In secret.

### Line 513 ###
- Why secret?

### Line 514 ###
Because public opinion wouldn't

### Line 515 ###
allow spending on space exploration.

### Line 516 ###
Not while you're struggling

### Line 517 ###
to put food on the table.

### Line 518 ###
Blight.

### Line 519 ###
Wheat seven years ago. Okra this year.

### Line 520 ###
Now there's just corn.

### Line 521 ###
And we're growing more than we ever have.

### Line 522 ###
But like the potatoes in Ireland

### Line 523 ###
and the wheat in the Dust Bowl...

### Line 524 ###
the corn will die.

### Line 525 ###
Soon.

### Line 526 ###
We'll find a way, professor.

### Line 527 ###
We always have.

### Line 528 ###
Driven by the unshakable faith

### Line 529 ###
the Earth is ours.

### Line 530 ###
Not just ours, no.

### Line 531 ###
But it is our home.

### Line 532 ###
Earth's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen.

### Line 533 ###
We don't even breathe nitrogen.

### Line 534 ###
Blight does. And as it thrives,

### Line 535 ###
our air gets less and less oxygen.

### Line 536 ###
The last people to starve

### Line 537 ###
will be the first to suffocate.

### Line 538 ###
And your daughter's generation...

### Line 539 ###
will be the last to survive on Earth.

### Line 540 ###
Murph is tired. I was wondering

### Line 541 ###
if she could take a nap in my office.

### Line 542 ###
Yeah. Thank you.

### Line 543 ###
Okay...

### Line 544 ###
now you need to tell me

### Line 545 ###
what your plan is to save the world.

### Line 546 ###
We're not meant to save the world.

### Line 547 ###
We're meant to leave it.

### Line 548 ###
Rangers.

### Line 549 ###
The last components of our one versatile

### Line 550 ###
ship in orbit, the Endurance.

### Line 551 ###
Our final expedition.

### Line 552 ###
You sent people out there

### Line 553 ###
looking for a new home?

### Line 554 ###
The Lazarus missions.

### Line 555 ###
- Oh, that sounds cheerful.

### Line 556 ###
- Lazarus came back from the dead.

### Line 557 ###
Sure, but he had to die in the first place.

### Line 558 ###
There's not a planet in our solar system

### Line 559 ###
that could sustain life...

### Line 560 ###
and the nearest star's

### Line 561 ###
over a thousand years away.

### Line 562 ###
That doesn't even qualify as futile.

### Line 563 ###
Where'd you send them?

### Line 564 ###
Cooper...

### Line 565 ###
I can't tell you anymore

### Line 566 ###
unless you agree...

### Line 567 ###
to pilot this craft.

### Line 568 ###
- You're the best pilot we ever had.

### Line 569 ###
- I barely left the stratosphere.

### Line 570 ###
This team never left the simulator.

### Line 571 ###
We need a pilot, and this is the mission

### Line 572 ###
that you were trained for.

### Line 573 ###
Without even knowing it?

### Line 574 ###
An hour ago, you didn't even know I

### Line 575 ###
was alive. You were going anyway.

### Line 576 ###
We had no choice.

### Line 577 ###
But something sent you here.

### Line 578 ###
- They chose you.

### Line 579 ###
- Who's "they"?

### Line 580 ###
How long would I be gone?

### Line 581 ###
Hard to know. Years?

### Line 582 ###
I've got kids, professor.

### Line 583 ###
Get out there and save them.

### Line 584 ###
Who's "they"?

### Line 585 ###
We started detecting gravitational

### Line 586 ###
anomalies almost 50 years ago.

### Line 587 ###
Mostly small distortions to our instruments

### Line 588 ###
in the upper atmosphere.

### Line 589 ###
In fact, I believe

### Line 590 ###
you encountered one yourself.

### Line 591 ###
Yeah, over the Straights.

### Line 592 ###
My crash. Something tripped my fly-by-wire.

### Line 593 ###
Exactly.

### Line 594 ###
But of all these anomalies,

### Line 595 ###
the most significant is this:

### Line 596 ###
Out near Saturn...

### Line 597 ###
a disturbance of space-time.

### Line 598 ###
- Is that a wormhole?

### Line 599 ###
- It appeared 48 years ago.

### Line 600 ###
And it leads where?

### Line 601 ###
Another galaxy.

### Line 602 ###
A wormhole's not

### Line 603 ###
a naturally occurring phenomenon.

### Line 604 ###
Someone placed it there.

### Line 605 ###
- "They"?

### Line 606 ###
- Mm.

### Line 607 ###
And whoever they are,

### Line 608 ###
they appear to be looking out for us.

### Line 609 ###
That wormhole lets us

### Line 610 ###
travel to other stars.

### Line 611 ###
It came along right as we needed it.

### Line 612 ###
They've put potentially habitable worlds

### Line 613 ###
right within our reach.

### Line 614 ###
Twelve, in fact, from our initial probes.

### Line 615 ###
- You sent probes into that?

### Line 616 ###
- Mm-hm.

### Line 617 ###
We sent people into it. Ten years ago.

### Line 618 ###
The Lazarus missions.

### Line 619 ###
Twelve possible worlds...

### Line 620 ###
twelve Ranger launches carrying...

### Line 621 ###
the bravest humans ever to live...

### Line 622 ###
led by the remarkable Dr. Mann.

### Line 623 ###
Each person's landing pod

### Line 624 ###
had enough life support for two years.

### Line 625 ###
But they could use hibernation

### Line 626 ###
to stretch that...

### Line 627 ###
making observations on organics

### Line 628 ###
over a decade or more.

### Line 629 ###
Their mission was to assess their world,

### Line 630 ###
and if it showed potential...

### Line 631 ###
then they could send out a signal, bed

### Line 632 ###
down for the long nap, wait to be rescued.

### Line 633 ###
And what if the world didn't show promise?

### Line 634 ###
Hence the bravery.

### Line 635 ###
You don't have the resources

### Line 636 ###
to visit all 12.

### Line 637 ###
No.

### Line 638 ###
Data transmission back through

### Line 639 ###
the wormhole is rudimentary.

### Line 640 ###
Simple binary pings on

### Line 641 ###
an annual basis give us

### Line 642 ###
some clue as to which

### Line 643 ###
worlds have potential.

### Line 644 ###
And one system shows promise.

### Line 645 ###
One. That's a bit of a long shot, isn't it?

### Line 646 ###
One system with three potential worlds?

### Line 647 ###
No long shot.

### Line 648 ###
Okay.

### Line 649 ###
So if we find a home...

### Line 650 ###
- then what?

### Line 651 ###
- That's the long shot.

### Line 652 ###
There's a Plan A and a Plan B.

### Line 653 ###
Did you notice anything strange

### Line 654 ###
about the launch chamber?

### Line 655 ###
This entire facility's a centrifuge.

### Line 656 ###
Some kind of vehicle. A space station?

### Line 657 ###
Both. Plan A.

### Line 658 ###
How do you get it off the ground?

### Line 659 ###
The first gravitational anomalies

### Line 660 ###
changed everything.

### Line 661 ###
Suddenly we knew

### Line 662 ###
that harnessing gravity was real.

### Line 663 ###
So I started working on a theory

### Line 664 ###
and we started building this station.

### Line 665 ###
But you haven't solved it yet.

### Line 666 ###
That's why there's Plan B.

### Line 667 ###
The problem is gravity. How to get a viable

### Line 668 ###
amount of human life off the planet.

### Line 669 ###
This is one way.

### Line 670 ###
Plan B: a population bomb.

### Line 671 ###
Over 5,000 fertilised eggs

### Line 672 ###
weighing in at just under 900 kilos.

### Line 673 ###
How would you raise them?

### Line 674 ###
With equipment on board,

### Line 675 ###
we incubate the first 10.

### Line 676 ###
After that, with surrogacy,

### Line 677 ###
the growth becomes exponential.

### Line 678 ###
Within 30 years,

### Line 679 ###
we could have a colony of hundreds.

### Line 680 ###
The real difficulty with colonisation

### Line 681 ###
is genetic diversity.

### Line 682 ###
This takes care of that.

### Line 683 ###
But what about the people here? You just...

### Line 684 ###
give up on them?

### Line 685 ###
My kids?

### Line 686 ###
That's why Plan A is a lot more fun.

### Line 687 ###
- How far have you got?

### Line 688 ###
- Almost there.

### Line 689 ###
You're asking me to hang everything...

### Line 690 ###
on an almost.

### Line 691 ###
I'm asking you to trust me.

### Line 692 ###
Find us a new home.

### Line 693 ###
And by the time you return...

### Line 694 ###
I will have solved

### Line 695 ###
the problem of gravity.

### Line 696 ###
I give you my word.

### Line 697 ###
Go away!

### Line 698 ###
Murph.

### Line 699 ###
Go! If you're leaving, just go.

### Line 700 ###
This world was never enough

### Line 701 ###
for you, was it, Coop?

### Line 702 ###
What, because heading out there

### Line 703 ###
is what I feel like I was born to do?

### Line 704 ###
And it excites me? Heh.

### Line 705 ###
No, that does not make it wrong.

### Line 706 ###
It might.

### Line 707 ###
Don't trust the right thing

### Line 708 ###
done for the wrong reason.

### Line 709 ###
The why of the thing,

### Line 710 ###
that's the foundation.

### Line 711 ###
And the foundation's solid.

### Line 712 ###
We farmers, we sit here every year

### Line 713 ###
when the rains fail and we say:

### Line 714 ###
"Next year."

### Line 715 ###
Well, next year ain't gonna save us,

### Line 716 ###
nor the one after that.

### Line 717 ###
This world's a treasure, Donald, but it's

### Line 718 ###
been telling us to leave for a while now.

### Line 719 ###
Mankind was born on Earth,

### Line 720 ###
it was never meant to die here.

### Line 721 ###
Tom will be all right, but you got

### Line 722 ###
to make things right with Murph.

### Line 723 ###
I will.

### Line 724 ###
Without making promises

### Line 725 ###
you don't know you can keep.

### Line 726 ###
You have to talk to me, Murph.

### Line 727 ###
I need to fix this before I go.

### Line 728 ###
Then I'll keep it

### Line 729 ###
broken so you have to stay.

### Line 730 ###
After you kids came along, your mom said

### Line 731 ###
something to me I never quite understood.

### Line 732 ###
She said, "Now...

### Line 733 ###
we're just here

### Line 734 ###
to be memories for our kids."

### Line 735 ###
And I think that now I understand

### Line 736 ###
what she meant.

### Line 737 ###
Once you're a parent,

### Line 738 ###
you're the ghost of your children's future.

### Line 739 ###
You said ghosts didn't exist.

### Line 740 ###
That's right, Murph.

### Line 741 ###
Murph, look at me.

### Line 742 ###
I can't be your ghost right now.

### Line 743 ###
I need to exist.

### Line 744 ###
They chose me.

### Line 745 ###
Murph, they chose me. You saw.

### Line 746 ###
You're the one who led me to them.

### Line 747 ###
That's exactly why you can't go.

### Line 748 ###
I figured out the message.

### Line 749 ###
- One word. Know what it is?

### Line 750 ###
- Murph.

### Line 751 ###
"Stay."

### Line 752 ###
- It says, "Stay," Dad.

### Line 753 ###
- Murph.

### Line 754 ###
You don't believe me.

### Line 755 ###
Look at the books! Look at this.

### Line 756 ###
It says, "Stay."

### Line 757 ###
Why...? You're not listening!

### Line 758 ###
It says, "Stay!"

### Line 759 ###
No, I'm coming back.

### Line 760 ###
When?

### Line 761 ###
One for you, one for me.

### Line 762 ###
When I'm up there in hypersleep, or...

### Line 763 ###
travelling near the speed of light, or...

### Line 764 ###
near a black hole...

### Line 765 ###
time's gonna change for me.

### Line 766 ###
It's gonna run more slowly.

### Line 767 ###
When we get back...

### Line 768 ###
we're gonna compare.

### Line 769 ###
- Time will run differently for us?

### Line 770 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 771 ###
By the time I get back,

### Line 772 ###
we might even be the same age, you and me.

### Line 773 ###
"What?" Imagine that!

### Line 774 ###
Aw, Murph...

### Line 775 ###
You have no idea when you're coming back.

### Line 776 ###
No idea at all!

### Line 777 ###
Murph, don't... Don't

### Line 778 ###
make me leave like this.

### Line 779 ###
Come on, Murph!

### Line 780 ###
Don't make me leave like this, Murph!

### Line 781 ###
Hey...

### Line 782 ###
I love you.

### Line 783 ###
Forever. You hear me?

### Line 784 ###
I love you forever, and I'm coming back.

### Line 785 ###
I'm coming back.

### Line 786 ###
- How'd it go?

### Line 787 ###
- Fine.

### Line 788 ###
Just fine.

### Line 789 ###
I love you, Tom.

### Line 790 ###
- Travel safe, huh?

### Line 791 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 792 ###
You look after our place for me, all right?

### Line 793 ###
- All right?

### Line 794 ###
- Uh-huh.

### Line 795 ###
Hey, can I use your

### Line 796 ###
truck while you're gone?

### Line 797 ###
You mean your truck?

### Line 798 ###
I'll make sure they bring it back.

### Line 799 ###
Look after my kids, Donald!

### Line 800 ###
Go for main engine start. T-minus 10...

### Line 801 ###
- Dad!

### Line 802 ###
- Nine... Dad!

### Line 803 ###
Eight...

### Line 804 ###
seven... Dad!

### Line 805 ###
Six...

### Line 806 ###
five, main engine start, four...

### Line 807 ###
three...

### Line 808 ###
two...

### Line 809 ###
one. Booster ignition and...

### Line 810 ###
All engines look good.

### Line 811 ###
Beginning roll program.

### Line 812 ###
Prepare for stage one separation.

### Line 813 ###
Stage one.

### Line 814 ###
There is Mach 1.

### Line 815 ###
Everybody good?

### Line 816 ###
Plenty of slaves for my robot colony?

### Line 817 ###
They gave him a humour setting

### Line 818 ###
so he'd fit in better with his unit.

### Line 819 ###
He thinks it relaxes us.

### Line 820 ###
A giant sarcastic robot.

### Line 821 ###
What a great idea!

### Line 822 ###
I have a cue light I can use

### Line 823 ###
when I'm joking if you like.

### Line 824 ###
That'd probably help.

### Line 825 ###
You can use it to find your way back to the

### Line 826 ###
ship after I blow you out the airlock.

### Line 827 ###
- What's your humour setting, TARS?

### Line 828 ###
- That's 100 percent.

### Line 829 ###
Let's bring it on down to 75, please.

### Line 830 ###
Stage two separation.

### Line 831 ###
All feeds going manual.

### Line 832 ###
Going manual.

### Line 833 ###
Deactivate probe heater one, two and three.

### Line 834 ###
Check.

### Line 835 ###
- Taking control.

### Line 836 ###
- This is handover to you.

### Line 837 ###
- A.D.F. check.

### Line 838 ###
- Over.

### Line 839 ###
Pull thrusters back.

### Line 840 ###
Fuel cells one, two, three.

### Line 841 ###
One hundred percent.

### Line 842 ###
Ex-mites.

### Line 843 ###
It's hard leaving everything.

### Line 844 ###
My kids. Your father.

### Line 845 ###
We're going to be spending

### Line 846 ###
a lot of time together.

### Line 847 ###
- We should learn to talk.

### Line 848 ###
- And when not to.

### Line 849 ###
Just being honest.

### Line 850 ###
I don't think you need to be that honest.

### Line 851 ###
Hey, TARS, what's your honesty parameter?

### Line 852 ###
- Ninety percent.

### Line 853 ###
- Ninety percent?

### Line 854 ###
Absolute honesty isn't always

### Line 855 ###
the most diplomatic, nor the...

### Line 856 ###
safest form of communication

### Line 857 ###
with emotional beings.

### Line 858 ###
Okay.

### Line 859 ###
Ninety percent it is, Dr. Brand.

### Line 860 ###
We are coming up on the Endurance.

### Line 861 ###
Twelve minutes out.

### Line 862 ###
Okay. Taking control.

### Line 863 ###
Approaching module port, 500 metres.

### Line 864 ###
It's all you, Doyle.

### Line 865 ###
Nice and easy, Doyle. Nice and easy.

### Line 866 ###
I feel good.

### Line 867 ###
Take us home.

### Line 868 ###
- Lock.

### Line 869 ###
- Target locked.

### Line 870 ###
- Well done.

### Line 871 ###
- Okay, helmets on.

### Line 872 ###
Good job.

### Line 873 ###
Door's not charging.

### Line 874 ###
Never mind.

### Line 875 ###
Cooper, you should have control.

### Line 876 ###
Control here.

### Line 877 ###
Communication with ring module active.

### Line 878 ###
Oh, wow.

### Line 879 ###
That's initiate.

### Line 880 ###
- Are we ready to spin?

### Line 881 ###
- Just a sec.

### Line 882 ###
- Hello, CASE.

### Line 883 ###
- Hello, TARS.

### Line 884 ###
All right, we're all set.

### Line 885 ###
All right, let's do it.

### Line 886 ###
Heh.

### Line 887 ###
Thirty percent of spin.

### Line 888 ###
One G.

### Line 889 ###
How's gravity treating you back there?

### Line 890 ###
Well.

### Line 891 ###
Romilly? Hey, you okay?

### Line 892 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 893 ###
- You all right?

### Line 894 ###
Mm. Yeah, I just need a minute.

### Line 895 ###
We have some Dramamine in the hab pod, or

### Line 896 ###
maybe in the cryo-beds. I'll just be a sec.

### Line 897 ###
- Hey, Brand?

### Line 898 ###
- Yeah?

### Line 899 ###
- Bring a lot.

### Line 900 ###
- Heh-heh-heh.

### Line 901 ###
Amelia, be safe.

### Line 902 ###
- Give my regards to Dr. Mann.

### Line 903 ###
- I will, Dad.

### Line 904 ###
It looks good for your trajectory.

### Line 905 ###
We've calculated two years to Saturn.

### Line 906 ###
That's a lot of Dramamine.

### Line 907 ###
Look after my family,

### Line 908 ###
will you, please, sir?

### Line 909 ###
We'll be waiting for you when you get back.

### Line 910 ###
A little older, a little wiser,

### Line 911 ###
but happy to see you.

### Line 912 ###
Do not go gentle into that good night

### Line 913 ###
Old age should burn and

### Line 914 ###
rave at close of day

### Line 915 ###
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

### Line 916 ###
Though wise men at their end

### Line 917 ###
Know dark is right

### Line 918 ###
Because their words had forked

### Line 919 ###
No lightning they

### Line 920 ###
Do not go gentle into that good night

### Line 921 ###
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

### Line 922 ###
- You good?

### Line 923 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 924 ###
Okay, thank you.

### Line 925 ###
Here. Pills.

### Line 926 ###
So alone.

### Line 927 ###
We have each other. Dr. Mann had it worse.

### Line 928 ###
No, I mean them.

### Line 929 ###
Hm?

### Line 930 ###
it's a perfect planet,

### Line 931 ###
and we won't find another one like her.

### Line 932 ###
No, it's not like looking for a new condo.

### Line 933 ###
The human race is going to be...

### Line 934 ###
adrift...

### Line 935 ###
desperate for a rock it can cling to

### Line 936 ###
while it catches its breath.

### Line 937 ###
We need to find that rock.

### Line 938 ###
And our three prospects

### Line 939 ###
are at the edge of what...

### Line 940 ###
might sustain human life.

### Line 941 ###
Laura Miller's planet is first.

### Line 942 ###
- Laura started our biology program.

### Line 943 ###
Mm-hm.

### Line 944 ###
- Uh, Wolf Edmunds is here.

### Line 945 ###
- Tell me about Edmunds.

### Line 946 ###
Oh, uh, Wolf's a particle physicist.

### Line 947 ###
None of them had families, huh?

### Line 948 ###
No. No attachments. My father insisted.

### Line 949 ###
They all knew the odds against

### Line 950 ###
ever seeing another human being again.

### Line 951 ###
I'm hoping we can surprise

### Line 952 ###
at least three of them.

### Line 953 ###
- How about Mann?

### Line 954 ###
- Dr. Mann?

### Line 955 ###
He's remarkable. He's the best of us.

### Line 956 ###
He inspired 11 people to follow him

### Line 957 ###
on the loneliest journey in human history.

### Line 958 ###
Scientists, explorers.

### Line 959 ###
That's what I love.

### Line 960 ###
You know, out there we face great odds.

### Line 961 ###
Death, but...

### Line 962 ###
not evil.

### Line 963 ###
You don't think nature can be evil?

### Line 964 ###
No. Formidable. Frightening. But...

### Line 965 ###
- no, not evil.

### Line 966 ###
- Hm.

### Line 967 ###
Is a lion evil

### Line 968 ###
because it rips a gazelle to shreds?

### Line 969 ###
Just what we take with us, then.

### Line 970 ###
Yeah.

### Line 971 ###
This crew represents the best of humanity.

### Line 972 ###
Even me, huh?

### Line 973 ###
You know what? We agreed, 90 percent.

### Line 974 ###
There you go.

### Line 975 ###
- Don't stay up.

### Line 976 ###
- I'll be there in a minute.

### Line 977 ###
Just remember, Coop,

### Line 978 ###
you are literally wasting your breath.

### Line 979 ###
Hey, TARS? Let's go over that

### Line 980 ###
trajectory one more time.

### Line 981 ###
Eight months to Mars.

### Line 982 ###
Counter-orbital slingshot around.

### Line 983 ###
Fourteen months to Saturn.

### Line 984 ###
Nothing's changed on that.

### Line 985 ###
Just let me ask you something.

### Line 986 ###
Dr. Brand and Edmunds...

### Line 987 ###
Why are you whispering?

### Line 988 ###
They can't hear you.

### Line 989 ###
Dr. Brand and Edmunds. They close?

### Line 990 ###
I wouldn't know.

### Line 991 ###
Is that 90 percent "wouldn't know"

### Line 992 ###
or 10 percent "wouldn't know"?

### Line 993 ###
- I also have a discretion setting, Cooper.

### Line 994 ###
- Aah.

### Line 995 ###
But not a poker face, Slick.

### Line 996 ###
Hey, guys.

### Line 997 ###
Uh, Dad's about to go

### Line 998 ###
down for the long nap.

### Line 999 ###
So I wanted to give you an update.

### Line 1000 ###
Uh...

### Line 1001 ###
The Earth looks amazing from here. Um...

### Line 1002 ###
You can't see any of the dust. Heh.

### Line 1003 ###
Um, I really hope you guys are doing great.

### Line 1004 ###
I know you'll get this message. Professor

### Line 1005 ###
Brand's assured me he'll get it to you.

### Line 1006 ###
Know that I love you.

### Line 1007 ###
- Is it him?

### Line 1008 ###
- I don't think so, Murph.

### Line 1009 ###
You must be Donald.

### Line 1010 ###
Hello, Murph.

### Line 1011 ###
Why are you in my dad's truck?

### Line 1012 ###
He wanted me to bring it for your brother.

### Line 1013 ###
He sent you a message.

### Line 1014 ###
She's pretty upset with him for leaving.

### Line 1015 ###
If you record any messages,

### Line 1016 ###
I can get them to transmit it to Cooper.

### Line 1017 ###
Murph is a bright spark.

### Line 1018 ###
Maybe I should fan the flame.

### Line 1019 ###
She's already making fools of her teachers.

### Line 1020 ###
So maybe she should come

### Line 1021 ###
and make a fool out of you.

### Line 1022 ###
- So where are they?

### Line 1023 ###
- Heading for Mars.

### Line 1024 ###
The next time you hear from Cooper,

### Line 1025 ###
they'll be coming up on Saturn.

### Line 1026 ###
As far as school goes...

### Line 1027 ###
the administration wants me

### Line 1028 ###
to repeat Plant Pathology. Which sucks.

### Line 1029 ###
But they said I could start

### Line 1030 ###
Advanced Agriculture a year early.

### Line 1031 ###
All right, I got to go, Dad.

### Line 1032 ###
Hope you're safe up there.

### Line 1033 ###
Um, sorry, Coop.

### Line 1034 ###
I asked Murph to say hi,

### Line 1035 ###
but she's as stubborn as her old man.

### Line 1036 ###
I'll try again next time.

### Line 1037 ###
You all right, Rom?

### Line 1038 ###
This gets to me, Cooper.

### Line 1039 ###
This. This.

### Line 1040 ###
Millimetres of aluminium, that's it,

### Line 1041 ###
and then nothing...

### Line 1042 ###
out there for millions of miles

### Line 1043 ###
won't kill us in seconds.

### Line 1044 ###
You know that some of the finest...

### Line 1045 ###
solo yachtsmen in the world

### Line 1046 ###
don't know how to swim?

### Line 1047 ###
They don't know how. And if they

### Line 1048 ###
go overboard, psst, they're done.

### Line 1049 ###
We're explorers, Rom.

### Line 1050 ###
This is our boat.

### Line 1051 ###
Here.

### Line 1052 ###
This is from the, uh, relay probe?

### Line 1053 ###
It was in orbit around the wormhole.

### Line 1054 ###
This is the wormhole,

### Line 1055 ###
and every time we'd come around...

### Line 1056 ###
we would receive images

### Line 1057 ###
from the other side of the foreign galaxy.

### Line 1058 ###
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.

### Line 1059 ###
Exactly.

### Line 1060 ###
So we got a pretty good idea what we're

### Line 1061 ###
gonna find on the other side, huh?

### Line 1062 ###
Navigationally.

### Line 1063 ###
Guys? We'll be approaching

### Line 1064 ###
the wormhole in about three hours.

### Line 1065 ###
Hey, Coop?

### Line 1066 ###
Can we stop the spinning?

### Line 1067 ###
Why?

### Line 1068 ###
Because we're close enough to see it now?

### Line 1069 ###
All right.

### Line 1070 ###
Thanks.

### Line 1071 ###
There, that's it! That's the wormhole!

### Line 1072 ###
Say it, don't spray it, Rom.

### Line 1073 ###
It's a sphere.

### Line 1074 ###
Of course it is. What, you...?

### Line 1075 ###
You thought it would just be a hole?

### Line 1076 ###
No, it's just that all the illustrations

### Line 1077 ###
I've ever seen, they...

### Line 1078 ###
In the illustrations,

### Line 1079 ###
they're trying to show you how it works.

### Line 1080 ###
So they say you want to go

### Line 1081 ###
from here to there.

### Line 1082 ###
- But it's too far, right?

### Line 1083 ###
- Mm-hm.

### Line 1084 ###
So a wormhole bends space like this,

### Line 1085 ###
so you can take a shortcut through...

### Line 1086 ###
a higher dimension.

### Line 1087 ###
Okay, so...

### Line 1088 ###
to show that, they've

### Line 1089 ###
turned three-dimensional

### Line 1090 ###
space into two dimensions...

### Line 1091 ###
which turns a wormhole

### Line 1092 ###
into two dimensions, a circle.

### Line 1093 ###
What's a circle in three dimensions?

### Line 1094 ###
- A sphere.

### Line 1095 ###
- Exactly.

### Line 1096 ###
A spherical hole.

### Line 1097 ###
But who put it there?

### Line 1098 ###
Who do we have to thank?

### Line 1099 ###
I'm not thanking anybody

### Line 1100 ###
until we get out of here in one piece, Rom.

### Line 1101 ###
Any trick to this, Doyle?

### Line 1102 ###
No one knows.

### Line 1103 ###
The others made it, right?

### Line 1104 ###
At least some of them.

### Line 1105 ###
Everybody ready to say goodbye

### Line 1106 ###
to our solar system?

### Line 1107 ###
To our galaxy.

### Line 1108 ###
Here we go.

### Line 1109 ###
The controls won't work here.

### Line 1110 ###
We're passing through the bulk.

### Line 1111 ###
It's space beyond our three dimensions.

### Line 1112 ###
All you can do is record and observe.

### Line 1113 ###
What is that?

### Line 1114 ###
I think it's them.

### Line 1115 ###
Distorting space-time.

### Line 1116 ###
Don't! Don't!

### Line 1117 ###
What was that?

### Line 1118 ###
The first handshake.

### Line 1119 ###
We're...

### Line 1120 ###
We're here.

### Line 1121 ###
So the lost communications came through.

### Line 1122 ###
- How?

### Line 1123 ###
- The relay on this side cached them.

### Line 1124 ###
So years of basic data. No real surprises.

### Line 1125 ###
Miller's site has kept pinging thumbs up,

### Line 1126 ###
as has Dr. Mann's. Um...

### Line 1127 ###
Edmunds' went down three years ago.

### Line 1128 ###
Transmitter failure?

### Line 1129 ###
Maybe. He was sending the thumbs up

### Line 1130 ###
right until it went dark.

### Line 1131 ###
But Miller's still looks

### Line 1132 ###
good though, right?

### Line 1133 ###
- Because she's coming up fast.

### Line 1134 ###
Mm-hm.

### Line 1135 ###
With one complication.

### Line 1136 ###
The planet is much closer to Gargantua

### Line 1137 ###
than we thought.

### Line 1138 ###
- Gargantua?

### Line 1139 ###
- It's what we're calling the black hole.

### Line 1140 ###
Miller's and Dr. Mann's

### Line 1141 ###
planets both orbit it.

### Line 1142 ###
- And Miller's is on the horizon?

### Line 1143 ###
- As a basketball around a hoop.

### Line 1144 ###
Landing there takes us dangerously close.

### Line 1145 ###
And a black hole that big

### Line 1146 ###
has a huge gravitational pull.

### Line 1147 ###
Look, I could swing around that

### Line 1148 ###
neutron star to decelerate.

### Line 1149 ###
No, it's not that. It's time.

### Line 1150 ###
The gravity on that planet will slow our

### Line 1151 ###
clock compared to Earth's drastically.

### Line 1152 ###
How bad?

### Line 1153 ###
Every hour we spend on

### Line 1154 ###
that planet will be...

### Line 1155 ###
seven years back on Earth.

### Line 1156 ###
Jesus.

### Line 1157 ###
Well, that's relativity, folks.

### Line 1158 ###
Well, we can't just drop down

### Line 1159 ###
there without...

### Line 1160 ###
Cooper, we have a mission.

### Line 1161 ###
Yeah, Doyle, we have a mission,

### Line 1162 ###
and our mission Plan A is...

### Line 1163 ###
to find a planet that can habitate

### Line 1164 ###
the people that are living on Earth now.

### Line 1165 ###
You can't just think about your family.

### Line 1166 ###
Now you have to think bigger.

### Line 1167 ###
I am thinking about my family

### Line 1168 ###
and millions of other families, okay?

### Line 1169 ###
Plan A does not work if the people on Earth

### Line 1170 ###
are dead by the time we pull it off.

### Line 1171 ###
No. It doesn't.

### Line 1172 ###
That's why there's a Plan B.

### Line 1173 ###
Okay. Cooper's right.

### Line 1174 ###
We need to think of time

### Line 1175 ###
as a resource, like

### Line 1176 ###
oxygen and food. Going

### Line 1177 ###
down will cost us.

### Line 1178 ###
All right, look.

### Line 1179 ###
Dr. Mann's data is promising,

### Line 1180 ###
but it will take months to get there.

### Line 1181 ###
And Edmunds', it's even further.

### Line 1182 ###
Miller hasn't sent much,

### Line 1183 ###
but what she has is

### Line 1184 ###
very promising. it's

### Line 1185 ###
water, it's organics...

### Line 1186 ###
- You don't find that every day.

### Line 1187 ###
- No, you don't.

### Line 1188 ###
And just think about the resources,

### Line 1189 ###
including time...

### Line 1190 ###
that would be spent

### Line 1191 ###
trying to get back here.

### Line 1192 ###
- Romilly...

### Line 1193 ###
- Yeah?

### Line 1194 ###
How far off from Miller's planet do we

### Line 1195 ###
have to be to stay out of the time shift?

### Line 1196 ###
Just back from the cusp.

### Line 1197 ###
All right, which is here,

### Line 1198 ###
just outside of Miller's planet.

### Line 1199 ###
- Right.

### Line 1200 ###
- Okay.

### Line 1201 ###
Here's Gargantua. Here's Miller's planet.

### Line 1202 ###
Instead of taking the Endurance into orbit

### Line 1203 ###
around Miller's planet...

### Line 1204 ###
which would conserve fuel,

### Line 1205 ###
but we would lose a lot of time...

### Line 1206 ###
what if we take a wider orbit around

### Line 1207 ###
Gargantua, parallel with Miller's planet...

### Line 1208 ###
outside of this time shift, to here?

### Line 1209 ###
Then we take the Ranger down,

### Line 1210 ###
we get Miller, we get her samples.

### Line 1211 ###
We come back, we analyse, we debrief.

### Line 1212 ###
We're in, we're out.

### Line 1213 ###
We lose a little fuel,

### Line 1214 ###
but we save a whole lot of time.

### Line 1215 ###
- That'll work.

### Line 1216 ###
- That's good.

### Line 1217 ###
There's no time for monkey business

### Line 1218 ###
or chit-chat down there.

### Line 1219 ###
So, TARS, you should definitely stay here.

### Line 1220 ###
CASE, you're with me. Anyone else can stay.

### Line 1221 ###
If we're talking about a couple years,

### Line 1222 ###
I could use the time to research gravity.

### Line 1223 ###
Observations from the wormhole,

### Line 1224 ###
that's gold to Professor Brand.

### Line 1225 ###
TARS, factor an orbit of Gargantua.

### Line 1226 ###
Conserve fuel, minimise thrusting, but make

### Line 1227 ###
sure we stay in range of Miller's planet.

### Line 1228 ###
- You got it?

### Line 1229 ###
- I wouldn't leave you behind...

### Line 1230 ###
Dr. Brand.

### Line 1231 ###
- You ready, CASE?

### Line 1232 ###
- Yup.

### Line 1233 ###
- You don't say much, do you?

### Line 1234 ###
- TARS talks plenty for both of us.

### Line 1235 ###
Detach.

### Line 1236 ###
- Romilly, are you reading these forces?

### Line 1237 ###
it's unbelievable.

### Line 1238 ###
A literal heart of darkness.

### Line 1239 ###
If we could just see

### Line 1240 ###
the collapsed star inside...

### Line 1241 ###
the singularity, yeah,

### Line 1242 ###
we'd solve gravity.

### Line 1243 ###
- And we can't get anything from it?

### Line 1244 ###
- Nothing escapes that horizon.

### Line 1245 ###
Not even light.

### Line 1246 ###
The answer's there,

### Line 1247 ###
just no way to see it.

### Line 1248 ###
There's Miller's planet.

### Line 1249 ###
Goodbye, Ranger.

### Line 1250 ###
This is fast for atmospheric entry.

### Line 1251 ###
- Should we use the thrusters to slow?

### Line 1252 ###
- No.

### Line 1253 ###
I'm gonna use the Ranger's aerodynamics

### Line 1254 ###
to save some fuel.

### Line 1255 ###
Air brake?

### Line 1256 ###
- We want to get down fast, don't we?

### Line 1257 ###
- We want to get there in one piece.

### Line 1258 ###
- Hang on.

### Line 1259 ###
- Brand, Doyle, get ready.

### Line 1260 ###
- We should ease!

### Line 1261 ###
- Hands where I can see them.

### Line 1262 ###
The only time I went down was when a

### Line 1263 ###
machine was easing at the wrong time.

### Line 1264 ###
A little caution...

### Line 1265 ###
Can get you killed,

### Line 1266 ###
like reckless driving.

### Line 1267 ###
- Cooper, it's too damn fast!

### Line 1268 ###
- I got this.

### Line 1269 ###
- Should I disable the feedback?

### Line 1270 ###
- No. I need to feel the air.

### Line 1271 ###
Here we go.

### Line 1272 ###
It's just water!

### Line 1273 ###
The stuff of life.

### Line 1274 ###
Twelve hundred metres.

### Line 1275 ###
- Do we have a fix on the beacon?

### Line 1276 ###
- Got it!

### Line 1277 ###
- Can you manoeuvre?

### Line 1278 ###
- I'll need to shave some speed.

### Line 1279 ###
I'm gonna spiral down on top of it.

### Line 1280 ###
Everybody hang on!

### Line 1281 ###
Seven hundred.

### Line 1282 ###
On my cue, CASE. On my cue.

### Line 1283 ###
Five hundred metres.

### Line 1284 ###
Fire!

### Line 1285 ###
Very graceful.

### Line 1286 ###
No.

### Line 1287 ###
But very efficient.

### Line 1288 ###
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

### Line 1289 ###
Go, go, go!

### Line 1290 ###
Seven years per hour here.

### Line 1291 ###
Let's make it count!

### Line 1292 ###
This way.

### Line 1293 ###
About 200 metres.

### Line 1294 ###
The gravity's punishing.

### Line 1295 ###
Been floating through space too long?

### Line 1296 ###
One hundred and thirty percent

### Line 1297 ###
Earth gravity.

### Line 1298 ###
Come on. Come on.

### Line 1299 ###
- There's nothing here.

### Line 1300 ###
- Should be right here.

### Line 1301 ###
If the signal's coming from here, then...

### Line 1302 ###
Her beacon.

### Line 1303 ###
Wreckage.

### Line 1304 ###
Where's the rest?

### Line 1305 ###
Towards the mountains!

### Line 1306 ###
Those aren't mountains.

### Line 1307 ###
They're waves.

### Line 1308 ###
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

### Line 1309 ###
That one's moving away from us.

### Line 1310 ###
We need the recorder.

### Line 1311 ###
Brand, Doyle, back to the Ranger now!

### Line 1312 ###
We're not leaving without her data.

### Line 1313 ###
Get back here now!

### Line 1314 ###
We do not have time!

### Line 1315 ###
The second wave is coming!

### Line 1316 ###
We're in the middle of a swell.

### Line 1317 ###
No, I got it.

### Line 1318 ###
Get your ass back to the Ranger now!

### Line 1319 ###
Brand, get back here now!

### Line 1320 ###
No, Cooper, go. Cooper, go.

### Line 1321 ###
I can't make it.

### Line 1322 ###
- Go!

### Line 1323 ###
- CASE, go get her.

### Line 1324 ###
- Go!

### Line 1325 ###
- Get up. Get up, Brand!

### Line 1326 ###
Go, go! Go!

### Line 1327 ###
- I'm not gonna make it!

### Line 1328 ###
- Yes, you are. Yes, you are!

### Line 1329 ###
Come on, CASE has her!

### Line 1330 ###
Get back here, Doyle!

### Line 1331 ###
Come on!

### Line 1332 ###
Get to the hatch!

### Line 1333 ###
Go, go! Go!

### Line 1334 ###
Shit.

### Line 1335 ###
Manually overriding inside hatch!

### Line 1336 ###
Cooper! Wait!

### Line 1337 ###
The engines are flooded!

### Line 1338 ###
I'm gonna have to shut her down.

### Line 1339 ###
Holy shit.

### Line 1340 ###
Hang on!

### Line 1341 ###
CASE, what's the problem?

### Line 1342 ###
Too waterlogged. Let it drain.

### Line 1343 ###
Goddamn it!

### Line 1344 ###
- I told you to leave me! Why didn't you?

### Line 1345 ###
- And I told you to get your ass back here!

### Line 1346 ###
- One of us was thinking about the mission!

### Line 1347 ###
- You were thinking about getting home.

### Line 1348 ###
I was trying to do the right thing!

### Line 1349 ###
Can you tell that to Doyle?

### Line 1350 ###
- CASE, how much time?

### Line 1351 ###
- Forty-five to an hour.

### Line 1352 ###
The stuff of life, huh?

### Line 1353 ###
What's this gonna cost us, Brand?

### Line 1354 ###
A lot. Decades.

### Line 1355 ###
What happened to Miller?

### Line 1356 ###
Judging by the wreckage, she was...

### Line 1357 ###
broken up by a wave soon after impact.

### Line 1358 ###
How's the wreckage stayed together

### Line 1359 ###
after all these years, huh?

### Line 1360 ###
Because of the time slippage.

### Line 1361 ###
On this planet's time,

### Line 1362 ###
she just landed hours ago.

### Line 1363 ###
She probably just died minutes ago.

### Line 1364 ###
The data Doyle received was just

### Line 1365 ###
the initial status echoing endlessly.

### Line 1366 ###
Oh, we are not prepared for this.

### Line 1367 ###
You eggheads have the survival skills

### Line 1368 ###
of a Boy Scout troop.

### Line 1369 ###
Well, we got this far on our brains.

### Line 1370 ###
Farther than any human in history.

### Line 1371 ###
Well, not far enough!

### Line 1372 ###
And now we're stuck here till there

### Line 1373 ###
won't be anyone left on Earth to save.

### Line 1374 ###
I'm counting every minute,

### Line 1375 ###
same as you, Cooper.

### Line 1376 ###
Is there any possibility...

### Line 1377 ###
some kind of a way

### Line 1378 ###
we can maybe all jump in a black hole?

### Line 1379 ###
Gain back the years?

### Line 1380 ###
Don't shake your head at me.

### Line 1381 ###
Time is relative, okay?

### Line 1382 ###
It can stretch and it can squeeze, but...

### Line 1383 ###
it can't run backwards. it just can't.

### Line 1384 ###
The only thing that can move across

### Line 1385 ###
dimensions, like time, is gravity.

### Line 1386 ###
Okay.

### Line 1387 ###
The beings that led us here,

### Line 1388 ###
they communicate...

### Line 1389 ###
- through gravity, right?

### Line 1390 ###
- Yes.

### Line 1391 ###
Could they be talking

### Line 1392 ###
to us from the future?

### Line 1393 ###
- Maybe.

### Line 1394 ###
- Okay. If they can...

### Line 1395 ###
"They" are beings of five dimensions.

### Line 1396 ###
To them, time might be

### Line 1397 ###
another physical dimension.

### Line 1398 ###
To them...

### Line 1399 ###
the past might be a canyon

### Line 1400 ###
that they can climb into and the future...

### Line 1401 ###
a mountain they can climb up.

### Line 1402 ###
But to us, it's not, okay?

### Line 1403 ###
Look, Cooper, I screwed up. I'm sorry.

### Line 1404 ###
But you knew about relativity.

### Line 1405 ###
Oh.

### Line 1406 ###
Brand...

### Line 1407 ###
My daughter was 10 years old.

### Line 1408 ###
I couldn't teach her

### Line 1409 ###
Einstein's theories before I left.

### Line 1410 ###
Couldn't you have told her

### Line 1411 ###
you were going to save the world?

### Line 1412 ###
No.

### Line 1413 ###
When you become a parent,

### Line 1414 ###
one thing becomes really clear.

### Line 1415 ###
And that is that you want to make sure

### Line 1416 ###
your children feel safe.

### Line 1417 ###
And it rules out telling a 10-year-old

### Line 1418 ###
that the world is ending.

### Line 1419 ###
Cooper?

### Line 1420 ###
- How long for the engines, CASE?

### Line 1421 ###
- A minute or two.

### Line 1422 ###
We don't have it. Helmets on!

### Line 1423 ###
Brand, co-pilot, you're up.

### Line 1424 ###
CASE, blow the cabin oxygen

### Line 1425 ###
through the main thrusters!

### Line 1426 ###
- We're gonna spark it.

### Line 1427 ###
- Roger that.

### Line 1428 ###
- Locked.

### Line 1429 ###
- Depressurising.

### Line 1430 ###
Engines up!

### Line 1431 ###
Hello, Rom.

### Line 1432 ###
I've waited years.

### Line 1433 ###
How...? How many years?

### Line 1434 ###
- By now it must be...

### Line 1435 ###
Twenty-three years...

### Line 1436 ###
four months, eight days.

### Line 1437 ###
Doyle?

### Line 1438 ###
I thought I was prepared.

### Line 1439 ###
I knew the theory.

### Line 1440 ###
Reality's different.

### Line 1441 ###
And Miller?

### Line 1442 ###
There's nothing here for us.

### Line 1443 ###
Why didn't you sleep?

### Line 1444 ###
Oh, I had a couple of stretches. But I

### Line 1445 ###
stopped believing you were coming back.

### Line 1446 ###
And something seemed wrong

### Line 1447 ###
about dreaming my life away.

### Line 1448 ###
I learned what I could

### Line 1449 ###
from the black hole...

### Line 1450 ###
but I couldn't send

### Line 1451 ###
anything to your father.

### Line 1452 ###
We've been receiving, but nothing gets out.

### Line 1453 ###
- Is he alive?

### Line 1454 ###
- Oh, yeah.

### Line 1455 ###
- Yeah?

### Line 1456 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 1457 ###
We've got years of messages stored.

### Line 1458 ###
Cooper.

### Line 1459 ###
Messages span 23 years.

### Line 1460 ###
Play it from the beginning.

### Line 1461 ###
Hey, Dad.

### Line 1462 ###
Checking in. Saying hi.

### Line 1463 ###
Um... Finished second in school.

### Line 1464 ###
Miss Kurling's still giving me C's though.

### Line 1465 ###
Pulled me down, but second's not bad.

### Line 1466 ###
Grandpa attended the ceremony.

### Line 1467 ###
Um... Oh.

### Line 1468 ###
I met another girl, Dad.

### Line 1469 ###
I, uh...

### Line 1470 ###
I really think this is the one.

### Line 1471 ###
Name's Lois. That's her right there.

### Line 1472 ###
Murphy stole Grandpa's car.

### Line 1473 ###
She crashed it. She's okay, though.

### Line 1474 ###
Hey, Dad.

### Line 1475 ###
Look at this!

### Line 1476 ###
You're a grandpa.

### Line 1477 ###
His name's Jesse.

### Line 1478 ###
I kind of wanted to call him Coop,

### Line 1479 ###
but Lois says, uh, maybe next time.

### Line 1480 ###
Donald says he's already earned the "great"

### Line 1481 ###
part, so we just leave it at that.

### Line 1482 ###
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

### Line 1483 ###
Say "Bye-bye, Grandpa."

### Line 1484 ###
Bye-bye, Grandpa. Okay.

### Line 1485 ###
Sorry it's been a while.

### Line 1486 ###
Just...

### Line 1487 ###
what with Jesse and all.

### Line 1488 ###
Uh...

### Line 1489 ###
Grandpa died last week.

### Line 1490 ###
We buried him out in the back forty

### Line 1491 ###
next to Mom and...

### Line 1492 ###
Jesse.

### Line 1493 ###
Which is where we would have buried you

### Line 1494 ###
if you'd ever...

### Line 1495 ###
come back.

### Line 1496 ###
Murph was there at the funeral.

### Line 1497 ###
We don't see her that much,

### Line 1498 ###
but she came for that.

### Line 1499 ###
You aren't listening to this, I know that.

### Line 1500 ###
All these messages are just, like...

### Line 1501 ###
drifting out there in the darkness.

### Line 1502 ###
Lois says that, uh...

### Line 1503 ###
I have to let you go.

### Line 1504 ###
And, uh...

### Line 1505 ###
so...

### Line 1506 ###
I guess I'm letting you go.

### Line 1507 ###
I don't know where you are, Dad...

### Line 1508 ###
but I hope that you're at peace.

### Line 1509 ###
Goodbye.

### Line 1510 ###
Hey, Dad.

### Line 1511 ###
Hey, Murph.

### Line 1512 ###
You son of a bitch.

### Line 1513 ###
I never made one of these

### Line 1514 ###
when you were still responding...

### Line 1515 ###
because I was so mad at you for leaving.

### Line 1516 ###
And then when you went quiet, it...

### Line 1517 ###
seemed like I should live

### Line 1518 ###
with that decision. And I have.

### Line 1519 ###
But today's my birthday.

### Line 1520 ###
And it's a special one,

### Line 1521 ###
because you told me...

### Line 1522 ###
You once told me that when you came back,

### Line 1523 ###
we might be the same age.

### Line 1524 ###
And today I'm the age you were

### Line 1525 ###
when you left.

### Line 1526 ###
So it would be a real good time

### Line 1527 ###
for you to come back.

### Line 1528 ###
I didn't mean to intrude. It's just that

### Line 1529 ###
I've never seen you in here before.

### Line 1530 ###
I've never been in here before.

### Line 1531 ###
I talk to Amelia all the time.

### Line 1532 ###
It helps.

### Line 1533 ###
- I'm glad you've started.

### Line 1534 ###
- I haven't. I...

### Line 1535 ###
I just had something I needed to get out.

### Line 1536 ###
- I know they're still out there.

### Line 1537 ###
- I know.

### Line 1538 ###
There are so many reasons their

### Line 1539 ###
communications might not

### Line 1540 ###
be getting through.

### Line 1541 ###
I know, professor.

### Line 1542 ###
I'm not sure what I'm more afraid of.

### Line 1543 ###
Them never coming back or...

### Line 1544 ###
coming back to find we've failed.

### Line 1545 ###
Then let's succeed.

### Line 1546 ###
So...

### Line 1547 ###
back to the fourth iteration.

### Line 1548 ###
Let's run it through some new fields.

### Line 1549 ###
With respect, professor,

### Line 1550 ###
we've tried that hundreds of times.

### Line 1551 ###
It only has to work once, Murph.

### Line 1552 ###
Every rivet that they strike

### Line 1553 ###
could have been a bullet.

### Line 1554 ###
We've done well for the world here...

### Line 1555 ###
whether or not we crack the equation

### Line 1556 ###
before I kick the bucket.

### Line 1557 ###
- Don't be morbid, professor.

### Line 1558 ###
- I'm not afraid of death.

### Line 1559 ###
I'm an old physicist.

### Line 1560 ###
I'm afraid of time.

### Line 1561 ###
Time.

### Line 1562 ###
You're afraid of time.

### Line 1563 ###
We've been trying to solve the equation...

### Line 1564 ###
without changing

### Line 1565 ###
the underlying assumption about time.

### Line 1566 ###
- And?

### Line 1567 ###
- And that means...

### Line 1568 ###
each iteration is an attempt

### Line 1569 ###
to prove its own proof.

### Line 1570 ###
It's recursive. It's nonsensical.

### Line 1571 ###
Are you calling my life's work...

### Line 1572 ###
nonsense, Murph?

### Line 1573 ###
No, I'm saying that

### Line 1574 ###
you've been trying to...

### Line 1575 ###
finish it with one arm... No, with

### Line 1576 ###
both arms... tied behind your back.

### Line 1577 ###
And I don't understand why.

### Line 1578 ###
I'm an old man, Murph.

### Line 1579 ###
Can we take this point up at another time?

### Line 1580 ###
I want to talk to my daughter.

### Line 1581 ###
Stepping out into the universe...

### Line 1582 ###
we must confront the reality

### Line 1583 ###
of interstellar travel.

### Line 1584 ###
We must reach far beyond

### Line 1585 ###
our own lifespans.

### Line 1586 ###
We must think not as individuals

### Line 1587 ###
but as a species.

### Line 1588 ###
Do not go gentle into that good night

### Line 1589 ###
TARS kept the Endurance

### Line 1590 ###
right where we needed her.

### Line 1591 ###
But the trip took years longer

### Line 1592 ###
than we anticipated.

### Line 1593 ###
We no longer have the fuel

### Line 1594 ###
to visit both prospects, so...

### Line 1595 ###
we have to choose.

### Line 1596 ###
But how?

### Line 1597 ###
They're both promising.

### Line 1598 ###
Edmunds' data is better, but Dr. Mann

### Line 1599 ###
is the one still transmitting, so...

### Line 1600 ###
We've no reason to suspect

### Line 1601 ###
Edmunds's data would have soured.

### Line 1602 ###
His world has key elements

### Line 1603 ###
to sustain human life.

### Line 1604 ###
- As does Dr. Mann's.

### Line 1605 ###
- Cooper, this is my field.

### Line 1606 ###
And...

### Line 1607 ###
I really believe Edmunds'

### Line 1608 ###
is the better prospect.

### Line 1609 ###
- Why?

### Line 1610 ###
- Gargantua, that's why.

### Line 1611 ###
Look at Miller's planet.

### Line 1612 ###
Hydrocarbons, organics, yes...

### Line 1613 ###
but no life. Sterile.

### Line 1614 ###
We'll find the same thing on Mann's.

### Line 1615 ###
Because of the black hole?

### Line 1616 ###
Murphy's Law.

### Line 1617 ###
Whatever can happen will happen.

### Line 1618 ###
Accident is the first building block

### Line 1619 ###
of evolution.

### Line 1620 ###
But when you're orbiting a black hole

### Line 1621 ###
not enough can happen.

### Line 1622 ###
It sucks in asteroids and comets, other

### Line 1623 ###
events which would otherwise reach you.

### Line 1624 ###
We need to go further afield.

### Line 1625 ###
You once said that Dr. Mann...

### Line 1626 ###
was the best of us.

### Line 1627 ###
He's remarkable.

### Line 1628 ###
We're only here because of him.

### Line 1629 ###
And yet...

### Line 1630 ###
Yet here he is.

### Line 1631 ###
He's on the ground, and he's sending

### Line 1632 ###
a very unambiguous message, telling us...

### Line 1633 ###
to come to his planet.

### Line 1634 ###
Granted, but Edmunds' data

### Line 1635 ###
is more promising.

### Line 1636 ###
We should vote.

### Line 1637 ###
Well, if we vote,

### Line 1638 ###
there's something you should know.

### Line 1639 ###
Brand?

### Line 1640 ###
He has a right to know.

### Line 1641 ###
That has nothing to do with it.

### Line 1642 ###
- What does?

### Line 1643 ###
- She's in love with Wolf Edmunds.

### Line 1644 ###
- Is that true?

### Line 1645 ###
- Yes.

### Line 1646 ###
And that makes me want to follow my heart.

### Line 1647 ###
But maybe we've spent too long

### Line 1648 ###
trying to figure all this out with theory.

### Line 1649 ###
You're a scientist, Brand.

### Line 1650 ###
So listen to me...

### Line 1651 ###
when I say that love

### Line 1652 ###
isn't something we invented. It's...

### Line 1653 ###
observable, powerful.

### Line 1654 ###
It has to mean something.

### Line 1655 ###
Love has meaning, yes. Social utility,

### Line 1656 ###
social bonding, child rearing...

### Line 1657 ###
We love people who have died.

### Line 1658 ###
Where's the social utility in that?

### Line 1659 ###
None.

### Line 1660 ###
Maybe it means something more,

### Line 1661 ###
something we can't...

### Line 1662 ###
yet understand.

### Line 1663 ###
Maybe it's some evidence, some...

### Line 1664 ###
artefact of a higher dimension

### Line 1665 ###
that we can't consciously perceive.

### Line 1666 ###
I'm drawn across the universe

### Line 1667 ###
to someone I haven't seen in a decade...

### Line 1668 ###
who I know is probably dead.

### Line 1669 ###
Love is the one thing

### Line 1670 ###
we're capable of perceiving...

### Line 1671 ###
that transcends dimensions

### Line 1672 ###
of time and space.

### Line 1673 ###
Maybe we should trust that,

### Line 1674 ###
even if we can't understand it yet.

### Line 1675 ###
All right, Cooper...

### Line 1676 ###
yes...

### Line 1677 ###
the tiniest possibility

### Line 1678 ###
of seeing Wolf again excites me.

### Line 1679 ###
That doesn't mean I'm wrong.

### Line 1680 ###
Honestly, Amelia...

### Line 1681 ###
it might.

### Line 1682 ###
TARS, chart a course for Dr. Mann's.

### Line 1683 ###
We'll lose about a third again.

### Line 1684 ###
But next year...

### Line 1685 ###
Next year I'm gonna work Nelson's farm

### Line 1686 ###
and we'll make it up.

### Line 1687 ###
What happened to Nelson?

### Line 1688 ###
Murph, would you like some more soufflÃ©?

### Line 1689 ###
Oh, no. I'm full, thanks. It was delicious.

### Line 1690 ###
Coop, finish your fritter, please.

### Line 1691 ###
Will you spend the night? Your room is

### Line 1692 ###
exactly as you left it. it's ready.

### Line 1693 ###
I need to get back.

### Line 1694 ###
My sewing machine is in there,

### Line 1695 ###
but there's plenty...

### Line 1696 ###
I need to...

### Line 1697 ###
Too many memories.

### Line 1698 ###
We might have something for that.

### Line 1699 ###
Hey, Coop.

### Line 1700 ###
The dust.

### Line 1701 ###
Lois, I have a friend who...

### Line 1702 ###
could look at his lungs.

### Line 1703 ###
- Amelia, I'm sorry.

### Line 1704 ###
- You were just being objective.

### Line 1705 ###
Unless you're punishing me

### Line 1706 ###
for screwing up on Miller's planet.

### Line 1707 ###
No, this wasn't a personal decision.

### Line 1708 ###
If you're wrong, you will have

### Line 1709 ###
a very personal decision to make.

### Line 1710 ###
Your fuel calculations

### Line 1711 ###
are based on a return journey.

### Line 1712 ###
Strike out on Mann's planet, and we'll have

### Line 1713 ###
to decide whether to return home...

### Line 1714 ###
or push on to Edmunds' with Plan B.

### Line 1715 ###
Starting a colony could save us

### Line 1716 ###
from extinction.

### Line 1717 ###
You might have to decide

### Line 1718 ###
between seeing your children again...

### Line 1719 ###
and the future of the human race.

### Line 1720 ###
I trust you'll be as objective then.

### Line 1721 ###
He's been asking for you since he came to.

### Line 1722 ###
We were trying to reach you.

### Line 1723 ###
Murph.

### Line 1724 ###
I'm here, professor.

### Line 1725 ###
I let you all down.

### Line 1726 ###
No, you got us so far. Real close.

### Line 1727 ###
I'll finish what you started.

### Line 1728 ###
Good, good Murph.

### Line 1729 ###
You had faith...

### Line 1730 ###
all those...

### Line 1731 ###
all those years.

### Line 1732 ###
I... I asked you to have faith.

### Line 1733 ###
I wanted you to believe...

### Line 1734 ###
that your father...

### Line 1735 ###
would come back.

### Line 1736 ###
I do, professor.

### Line 1737 ###
Forgive me, Murph.

### Line 1738 ###
There's nothing to forgive.

### Line 1739 ###
I...

### Line 1740 ###
I lied, Murph.

### Line 1741 ###
I lied to you.

### Line 1742 ###
There was no need for him to...

### Line 1743 ###
To come back.

### Line 1744 ###
There is no way to help us.

### Line 1745 ###
But Plan A...

### Line 1746 ###
All this. All these people.

### Line 1747 ###
And the equation.

### Line 1748 ###
Did my father know?

### Line 1749 ###
Did he leave me?

### Line 1750 ###
Do...

### Line 1751 ###
not...

### Line 1752 ###
go...

### Line 1753 ###
gentle...

### Line 1754 ###
No.

### Line 1755 ###
No!

### Line 1756 ###
You can't leave.

### Line 1757 ###
You... No.

### Line 1758 ###
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you that

### Line 1759 ###
your father died today. He had no pain.

### Line 1760 ###
He was at peace.

### Line 1761 ###
I'm very sorry for your loss.

### Line 1762 ###
Brand, did you know?

### Line 1763 ###
He told you, right?

### Line 1764 ###
You knew.

### Line 1765 ###
This was all a sham.

### Line 1766 ###
You left us here.

### Line 1767 ###
To suffocate.

### Line 1768 ###
To starve.

### Line 1769 ###
Frozen cloud.

### Line 1770 ###
It's okay.

### Line 1771 ###
It's okay.

### Line 1772 ###
It's okay.

### Line 1773 ###
Pray you never learn...

### Line 1774 ###
just how good it can be

### Line 1775 ###
to see another face.

### Line 1776 ###
I hadn't a lot of hope

### Line 1777 ###
to begin with, but...

### Line 1778 ###
after so long, I had none.

### Line 1779 ###
My supplies were completely exhausted.

### Line 1780 ###
The last time I went to sleep,

### Line 1781 ###
I didn't even set a waking date.

### Line 1782 ###
You have literally raised me from the dead.

### Line 1783 ###
- Lazarus.

### Line 1784 ###
- Hm.

### Line 1785 ###
- What about the others?

### Line 1786 ###
- I'm afraid you're it, sir.

### Line 1787 ###
So far, surely.

### Line 1788 ###
No, our present situation is that there's

### Line 1789 ###
very little chance of rescuing any others.

### Line 1790 ###
Dr. Mann. Dr. Mann?

### Line 1791 ###
Tell us about your world.

### Line 1792 ###
Our world, we hope.

### Line 1793 ###
Our world, uh, is cold...

### Line 1794 ###
stark...

### Line 1795 ###
but undeniably beautiful.

### Line 1796 ###
The days are 67 hours long, cold.

### Line 1797 ###
The nights are... 67

### Line 1798 ###
far colder hours.

### Line 1799 ###
The gravity is a very, very pleasant

### Line 1800 ###
Now, up here where I landed,

### Line 1801 ###
the water is alkali...

### Line 1802 ###
and the air has too much ammonia to

### Line 1803 ###
breathe for more than just a few minutes...

### Line 1804 ###
but down at the surface,

### Line 1805 ###
and there is a surface...

### Line 1806 ###
the chlorine dissipates.

### Line 1807 ###
The ammonia gives way to crystalline

### Line 1808 ###
hydrocarbons and breathable air.

### Line 1809 ###
To organics.

### Line 1810 ###
Possibly even to life.

### Line 1811 ###
We might be sharing this world.

### Line 1812 ###
These readings are from the surface?

### Line 1813 ###
Over the years, I've

### Line 1814 ###
dropped various probes.

### Line 1815 ###
- How far have you explored?

### Line 1816 ###
- I've mounted several major expeditions.

### Line 1817 ###
But with oxygen in limited supply,

### Line 1818 ###
KIPP there really did most of the legwork.

### Line 1819 ###
- What went wrong with him, sir?

### Line 1820 ###
- Degeneration.

### Line 1821 ###
He misidentified the first organics

### Line 1822 ###
we found as ammonia crystals.

### Line 1823 ###
We struggled on for a time,

### Line 1824 ###
but ultimately I decommissioned him and...

### Line 1825 ###
used his power source

### Line 1826 ###
to keep the mission going.

### Line 1827 ###
I thought I was alone

### Line 1828 ###
before I shut him down.

### Line 1829 ###
Would you like me to look at him?

### Line 1830 ###
No. No. He needs a human touch.

### Line 1831 ###
Dr. Brand, CASE is relaying a message

### Line 1832 ###
for you from the comm station.

### Line 1833 ###
Okay. Be right there. Excuse me.

### Line 1834 ###
Dr. Brand, I'm sorry to tell you

### Line 1835 ###
that your father died today.

### Line 1836 ###
He had no pain.

### Line 1837 ###
He was at peace.

### Line 1838 ###
I'm sorry for your loss.

### Line 1839 ###
Is that Murph?

### Line 1840 ###
She's... She's grown.

### Line 1841 ###
Brand, did you know?

### Line 1842 ###
He told you, right?

### Line 1843 ###
You knew.

### Line 1844 ###
This was all a sham.

### Line 1845 ###
You left us here.

### Line 1846 ###
To suffocate.

### Line 1847 ###
To starve.

### Line 1848 ###
Did my father know too?

### Line 1849 ###
Dad?

### Line 1850 ###
I just want to know...

### Line 1851 ###
if you left me here to die.

### Line 1852 ###
I just have to know.

### Line 1853 ###
Cooper, my...

### Line 1854 ###
My father dedicated...

### Line 1855 ###
his whole life to Plan A.

### Line 1856 ###
I have no idea what she's talking about.

### Line 1857 ###
I do.

### Line 1858 ###
He never even hoped

### Line 1859 ###
to get the people off the Earth?

### Line 1860 ###
No.

### Line 1861 ###
But he's been trying to solve

### Line 1862 ###
the gravity equation for 40 years.

### Line 1863 ###
Amelia, your father solved his equation

### Line 1864 ###
before I even left.

### Line 1865 ###
Then why wouldn't he use it?

### Line 1866 ###
The equation couldn't reconcile relativity

### Line 1867 ###
with quantum mechanics. You need more.

### Line 1868 ###
More? More what?

### Line 1869 ###
More data. You need

### Line 1870 ###
to see into a black hole.

### Line 1871 ###
The laws of nature prohibit

### Line 1872 ###
a naked singularity.

### Line 1873 ###
Romilly, is that true?

### Line 1874 ###
If a black hole is an oyster,

### Line 1875 ###
then the singularity's the pearl inside.

### Line 1876 ###
The gravity's so strong,

### Line 1877 ###
it's always hidden in darkness...

### Line 1878 ###
behind the horizon.

### Line 1879 ###
That's why we call it a black hole.

### Line 1880 ###
Okay, but if we see beyond the horizon...

### Line 1881 ###
We can't, Coop.

### Line 1882 ###
There are some things

### Line 1883 ###
that aren't meant to be known.

### Line 1884 ###
Your father had to find another way

### Line 1885 ###
to save the human race from extinction.

### Line 1886 ###
Plan B. A colony.

### Line 1887 ###
Why not tell people?

### Line 1888 ###
- Why keep building those stations?

### Line 1889 ###
- He knew how hard it would be...

### Line 1890 ###
to get people to work together

### Line 1891 ###
to save the species instead of themselves.

### Line 1892 ###
Or their children.

### Line 1893 ###
Bullshit.

### Line 1894 ###
You never would've come

### Line 1895 ###
unless you believed you would save them.

### Line 1896 ###
Evolution has yet to transcend

### Line 1897 ###
that simple barrier.

### Line 1898 ###
We can care deeply, selflessly about...

### Line 1899 ###
those we know, but that empathy

### Line 1900 ###
rarely extends beyond our line of sight.

### Line 1901 ###
But the lie.

### Line 1902 ###
That monstrous lie?

### Line 1903 ###
Unforgivable.

### Line 1904 ###
And he knew that.

### Line 1905 ###
He was prepared to destroy his own humanity

### Line 1906 ###
in order to save the species.

### Line 1907 ###
- He made an incredible sacrifice.

### Line 1908 ###
- No.

### Line 1909 ###
An incredible sacrifice is being made

### Line 1910 ###
by the people on Earth who are gonna die!

### Line 1911 ###
Because in his fucking arrogance...

### Line 1912 ###
he declared their case hopeless.

### Line 1913 ###
I'm sorry, Cooper...

### Line 1914 ###
their case is hopeless.

### Line 1915 ###
No. No.

### Line 1916 ###
We are the future.

### Line 1917 ###
Cooper, what can I do?

### Line 1918 ###
Let me go home.

### Line 1919 ###
You're absolutely positive?

### Line 1920 ###
His solution was correct.

### Line 1921 ###
He'd had it for years.

### Line 1922 ###
- It's worthless?

### Line 1923 ###
- It's half the answer.

### Line 1924 ###
Okay, how do you find the other half?

### Line 1925 ###
Out there? A black hole.

### Line 1926 ###
- But stuck down here on Earth?

### Line 1927 ###
- Yeah?

### Line 1928 ###
I'm not sure you can.

### Line 1929 ###
God, they just pack up and leave.

### Line 1930 ###
What are they hoping to find?

### Line 1931 ###
Survival.

### Line 1932 ###
Damn it.

### Line 1933 ###
Murph, don't...?

### Line 1934 ###
Don't people have a right to know?

### Line 1935 ###
Panic won't help.

### Line 1936 ###
We just have to keep working, same as ever.

### Line 1937 ###
But isn't that exactly what Professor Brand

### Line 1938 ###
was manipulating us to do?

### Line 1939 ###
Brand gave up on us.

### Line 1940 ###
I'm still trying to solve this.

### Line 1941 ###
So...

### Line 1942 ###
do you have an idea?

### Line 1943 ###
A feeling.

### Line 1944 ###
I told you about my ghost.

### Line 1945 ###
My dad thought I called it a ghost...

### Line 1946 ###
because I was scared of it.

### Line 1947 ###
But I was never scared of it.

### Line 1948 ###
I called it a ghost because it felt...

### Line 1949 ###
It felt like a person.

### Line 1950 ###
It was trying to tell me something.

### Line 1951 ###
If there's an answer here on Earth,

### Line 1952 ###
it's back there...

### Line 1953 ###
somehow, in that room.

### Line 1954 ###
So I have to find it.

### Line 1955 ###
We're running out of time.

### Line 1956 ###
What about auxiliary oxygen scrubbers?

### Line 1957 ###
No, they can stay.

### Line 1958 ###
I'll be sleeping anyway.

### Line 1959 ###
- Hey, Coop?

### Line 1960 ###
- Yeah?

### Line 1961 ###
I have a suggestion for

### Line 1962 ###
your return journey.

### Line 1963 ###
- Yeah, what's that?

### Line 1964 ###
- Have one last crack at the black hole.

### Line 1965 ###
I'm going home, Rom.

### Line 1966 ###
Yeah, I know.

### Line 1967 ###
This isn't going to cost you any time.

### Line 1968 ###
There's a chance for the people on Earth.

### Line 1969 ###
- Talk to me.

### Line 1970 ###
- Gargantua's an older spinning black hole.

### Line 1971 ###
- It's what we call a gentle singularity.

### Line 1972 ###
- Gentle?

### Line 1973 ###
They're hardly gentle.

### Line 1974 ###
But the tidal gravity is so quick that...

### Line 1975 ###
something crossing the horizon fast

### Line 1976 ###
might survive. A probe, say.

### Line 1977 ###
- What happens after it crosses?

### Line 1978 ###
- After the horizon is a complete mystery.

### Line 1979 ###
So, what's to say

### Line 1980 ###
there isn't some way that the probe...

### Line 1981 ###
can glimpse the singularity

### Line 1982 ###
and relay the quantum data?

### Line 1983 ###
If he's equipped to transmit

### Line 1984 ###
every form of energy that can pulse.

### Line 1985 ###
Just when did this probe

### Line 1986 ###
become a "he," professor?

### Line 1987 ###
TARS is the obvious candidate.

### Line 1988 ###
I've already told him what to look for.

### Line 1989 ###
I'd need the old optical transmitter

### Line 1990 ###
off KIPP, Cooper.

### Line 1991 ###
You'd do this for us?

### Line 1992 ###
Before you get all teary, remember that

### Line 1993 ###
as a robot I have to do anything you say.

### Line 1994 ###
Your cue light's broken.

### Line 1995 ###
I'm not joking.

### Line 1996 ###
I'll need TARS to remove and adapt

### Line 1997 ###
some components from KIPP.

### Line 1998 ###
I don't want to disturb

### Line 1999 ###
his archival functions.

### Line 2000 ###
I'll supervise.

### Line 2001 ###
All right.

### Line 2002 ###
Dr. Mann, we need to

### Line 2003 ###
find three secure

### Line 2004 ###
sites. One for Brand's

### Line 2005 ###
lab, two for habitat.

### Line 2006 ###
Once those modules have landed,

### Line 2007 ###
you don't want to move them.

### Line 2008 ###
I can take you to the probe sites,

### Line 2009 ###
but I don't think...

### Line 2010 ###
these conditions will hold.

### Line 2011 ###
I think we should wait.

### Line 2012 ###
CASE is headed down

### Line 2013 ###
with the rest of the distillery equipment.

### Line 2014 ###
I'd really like to secure

### Line 2015 ###
those sites by nightfall.

### Line 2016 ###
Well, these squalls do usually blow over.

### Line 2017 ###
Okay, then.

### Line 2018 ###
- You'll need a long-range transmitter.

### Line 2019 ###
- Got it.

### Line 2020 ###
- Are you charged?

### Line 2021 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 2022 ###
Follow me.

### Line 2023 ###
TARS, 72 hours, yeah?

### Line 2024 ###
Roger that, Cooper.

### Line 2025 ###
Brand told me why you feel

### Line 2026 ###
you have to go back.

### Line 2027 ###
But I'd be remiss

### Line 2028 ###
if I didn't at least mention...

### Line 2029 ###
that a mission such as ours

### Line 2030 ###
could certainly use an extra engineer.

### Line 2031 ###
You better slow down, turbo.

### Line 2032 ###
Safety first, CASE, remember.

### Line 2033 ###
Safety first, Cooper.

### Line 2034 ###
I have to tell you, Dr. Mann,

### Line 2035 ###
I'm honoured to be a part of this.

### Line 2036 ###
But once we set up base camp and secure

### Line 2037 ###
those modules, my work's done here.

### Line 2038 ###
I'm going home.

### Line 2039 ###
You have attachments.

### Line 2040 ###
But even without a family...

### Line 2041 ###
I can promise you that that yearning

### Line 2042 ###
to be with other people is powerful.

### Line 2043 ###
That emotion is at the foundation...

### Line 2044 ###
of what makes us human.

### Line 2045 ###
It's not to be taken lightly.

### Line 2046 ###
- How long have you had that cough?

### Line 2047 ###
- A while.

### Line 2048 ###
Mom lets me play in here.

### Line 2049 ###
I don't touch your stuff.

### Line 2050 ###
Just take this gently.

### Line 2051 ###
You know why we couldn't just send machines

### Line 2052 ###
on these missions, don't you?

### Line 2053 ###
A machine doesn't improvise well

### Line 2054 ###
because you can't program a fear of death.

### Line 2055 ###
Our survival instinct is

### Line 2056 ###
our single greatest...

### Line 2057 ###
source of inspiration.

### Line 2058 ###
Take you, for example.

### Line 2059 ###
A father...

### Line 2060 ###
with a survival instinct

### Line 2061 ###
that extends to your kids.

### Line 2062 ###
What does research tell us is the last

### Line 2063 ###
thing you're going to see before you die?

### Line 2064 ###
Your children. Their faces.

### Line 2065 ###
At the moment of death,

### Line 2066 ###
your mind's gonna push...

### Line 2067 ###
a little bit harder to survive.

### Line 2068 ###
For them.

### Line 2069 ###
Deep breath.

### Line 2070 ###
Uh, hey. I bet you're Coop.

### Line 2071 ###
Why don't you have a seat here for me?

### Line 2072 ###
It's bad. They cannot stay here.

### Line 2073 ###
- Okay?

### Line 2074 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 2075 ###
TARS, what's taking so long?

### Line 2076 ###
Professor, I am having trouble

### Line 2077 ###
completing the boot up.

### Line 2078 ###
I don't understand.

### Line 2079 ###
It's funny.

### Line 2080 ###
When I left Earth...

### Line 2081 ###
I thought I was prepared to die.

### Line 2082 ###
The truth is...

### Line 2083 ###
I never really considered the

### Line 2084 ###
possibility that my planet wasn't the one.

### Line 2085 ###
Nothing worked out the way

### Line 2086 ###
it was supposed to.

### Line 2087 ###
Let's go.

### Line 2088 ###
All right, buddy, give

### Line 2089 ###
me a big deep breath.

### Line 2090 ###
What is this?

### Line 2091 ###
What are you doing?

### Line 2092 ###
I'm sorry! I can't let

### Line 2093 ###
you leave with that ship.

### Line 2094 ###
We're gonna need it

### Line 2095 ###
to complete the mission...

### Line 2096 ###
once the others realise

### Line 2097 ###
what this place isn't.

### Line 2098 ###
We cannot survive here. I'm sorry!

### Line 2099 ###
I'm sorry!

### Line 2100 ###
- They can't stay here anymore.

### Line 2101 ###
- You have to leave right now.

### Line 2102 ###
Let me make something abundantly clear.

### Line 2103 ###
You have a responsibility...

### Line 2104 ###
- Oh! Jesus!

### Line 2105 ###
- Coop, get her stuff. She's going home.

### Line 2106 ###
Dad didn't raise you to be this dumb, Tom!

### Line 2107 ###
Dad didn't raise me, Grandpa did. And

### Line 2108 ###
he's buried out back with Mom and Jesse.

### Line 2109 ###
You faked all the data?

### Line 2110 ###
Yeah.

### Line 2111 ###
There's no surface?

### Line 2112 ###
No.

### Line 2113 ###
I tried to do my duty, Cooper...

### Line 2114 ###
but I knew the day that I arrived here

### Line 2115 ###
that this place had nothing.

### Line 2116 ###
And I resisted the temptation for years...

### Line 2117 ###
but I knew that...

### Line 2118 ###
if I just pressed that button, then...

### Line 2119 ###
somebody would come and save me.

### Line 2120 ###
You fucking coward.

### Line 2121 ###
Yes.

### Line 2122 ###
Yes.

### Line 2123 ###
Yes.

### Line 2124 ###
Yes.

### Line 2125 ###
Listen, if you're not going to go,

### Line 2126 ###
let your family go. Just save your family.

### Line 2127 ###
And we go live underground with you?

### Line 2128 ###
Pray that Daddy comes to save us?

### Line 2129 ###
Dad's not coming back.

### Line 2130 ###
He never was coming back. It's up to me.

### Line 2131 ###
You're gonna save everybody?

### Line 2132 ###
- Because Dad couldn't do it.

### Line 2133 ###
- Dad didn't even try!

### Line 2134 ###
Dad just abandoned us!

### Line 2135 ###
He left us here to die.

### Line 2136 ###
Nobody's going with you.

### Line 2137 ###
You gonna wait for your next kid to die?

### Line 2138 ###
Get out.

### Line 2139 ###
And don't come back.

### Line 2140 ###
You can keep my stuff.

### Line 2141 ###
Stop it!

### Line 2142 ###
No. No!

### Line 2143 ###
Dr. Mann, there's a 50-50 chance

### Line 2144 ###
you're gonna kill yourself!

### Line 2145 ###
Those are the best odds I've had in years.

### Line 2146 ###
Don't judge me, Cooper.

### Line 2147 ###
You were never tested like I was.

### Line 2148 ###
Few men have been.

### Line 2149 ###
You tried your best, Murph.

### Line 2150 ###
You're feeling it, aren't you?

### Line 2151 ###
The survival instinct.

### Line 2152 ###
That's what drove me. it's what drives all

### Line 2153 ###
of us. And it's what's gonna save us.

### Line 2154 ###
Because I want to save all of us.

### Line 2155 ###
For you, Cooper.

### Line 2156 ###
I'm sorry, I can't watch you

### Line 2157 ###
go through this. I'm sorry.

### Line 2158 ###
I thought I could, but I can't.

### Line 2159 ###
I'm here. I'm here for you.

### Line 2160 ###
Just listen to my voice, Cooper.

### Line 2161 ###
I'm right here.

### Line 2162 ###
You're not alone.

### Line 2163 ###
Do you see your children?

### Line 2164 ###
It's okay.

### Line 2165 ###
They're right there with you.

### Line 2166 ###
Did Professor Brand tell you

### Line 2167 ###
that poem before you left?

### Line 2168 ###
Do you remember?

### Line 2169 ###
Do not go gentle into that good night

### Line 2170 ###
Old age should burn and rave

### Line 2171 ###
At close of day

### Line 2172 ###
Rage, rage against the dying of the light

### Line 2173 ###
flag{D0_n0t_g0_g3ntle_into_that_g0od_n1ght}

### Line 2174 ###
Brand! Help!

### Line 2175 ###
- Help!

### Line 2176 ###
- Cooper?

### Line 2177 ###
CASE!

### Line 2178 ###
No air.

### Line 2179 ###
Ammonia.

### Line 2180 ###
Cooper. Cooper, we're coming! CASE!

### Line 2181 ###
- I have a fix.

### Line 2182 ###
- Go! Go, go, go!

### Line 2183 ###
And away!

### Line 2184 ###
Cooper, we're coming.

### Line 2185 ###
Hang in there. Don't talk.

### Line 2186 ###
Try to breathe as little as possible.

### Line 2187 ###
We're almost there.

### Line 2188 ###
There's a security lockout, sir.

### Line 2189 ###
It requires a person to access function.

### Line 2190 ###
It's all yours, sir.

### Line 2191 ###
Try not to breathe.

### Line 2192 ###
We're coming. We're coming right now.

### Line 2193 ###
CASE, come on! Come on!

### Line 2194 ###
We got to go faster, CASE!

### Line 2195 ###
Faster, faster, faster!

### Line 2196 ###
Hang in there. Come on.

### Line 2197 ###
I see him, I see him! CASE, bank!

### Line 2198 ###
Bank right!

### Line 2199 ###
Cooper! Cooper!

### Line 2200 ###
I'm here!

### Line 2201 ###
This data makes no sense.

### Line 2202 ###
I'm sorry.

### Line 2203 ###
- What?

### Line 2204 ###
- Mann was lying!

### Line 2205 ###
Go. Go.

### Line 2206 ###
Romilly.

### Line 2207 ###
Romilly!

### Line 2208 ###
Romilly! Do you read me, Romilly?

### Line 2209 ###
Step back, professor! Step back!

### Line 2210 ###
- Romilly...

### Line 2211 ###
- Romilly, do you read me?

### Line 2212 ###
Keep watch!

### Line 2213 ###
Lois?

### Line 2214 ###
- What happened to caution, CASE?

### Line 2215 ###
- Safety first, Cooper.

### Line 2216 ###
Romilly? Romilly, do you read me?

### Line 2217 ###
This is Brand.

### Line 2218 ###
Romilly?

### Line 2219 ###
Dr. Brand. Cooper.

### Line 2220 ###
There's been an explosion.

### Line 2221 ###
Dr. Mann's compound.

### Line 2222 ###
TARS, TARS, 10 o'clock!

### Line 2223 ###
Let me know when TARS is aboard.

### Line 2224 ###
Romilly did not survive.

### Line 2225 ###
I could not save him.

### Line 2226 ###
- TARS is in.

### Line 2227 ###
- I'll take her now.

### Line 2228 ###
- Do we have a fix on the Ranger?

### Line 2229 ###
- He's pushing into orbit!

### Line 2230 ###
If he takes control of

### Line 2231 ###
that ship, we're dead.

### Line 2232 ###
- He'd maroon us?

### Line 2233 ###
- He is marooning us.

### Line 2234 ###
I'll meet you guys downstairs.

### Line 2235 ###
Go wait by the car.

### Line 2236 ###
Come on! Give me your bag. Get in the

### Line 2237 ###
backseat. Get in the backseat now!

### Line 2238 ###
Dr. Mann, please respond.

### Line 2239 ###
Dr. Mann, please respond!

### Line 2240 ###
He doesn't know

### Line 2241 ###
the Endurance docking procedure.

### Line 2242 ###
- The autopilot does.

### Line 2243 ###
- Not since TARS disabled it.

### Line 2244 ###
Nice.

### Line 2245 ###
- What's your trust setting, TARS?

### Line 2246 ###
- Lower than yours apparently.

### Line 2247 ###
Do not attempt docking.

### Line 2248 ###
I repeat, do not attempt docking.

### Line 2249 ###
Please res...

### Line 2250 ###
Auto-docking sequence withheld.

### Line 2251 ###
- Override.

### Line 2252 ###
- Unauthorised.

### Line 2253 ###
Override.

### Line 2254 ###
Unauthorised.

### Line 2255 ###
Do not attempt docking. I repeat,

### Line 2256 ###
do not attempt docking. Please resp...

### Line 2257 ###
Moving slowly toward the Endurance.

### Line 2258 ###
Imperfect contact.

### Line 2259 ###
- Override.

### Line 2260 ###
- Hatch lockout.

### Line 2261 ###
- Is he locked on yet?

### Line 2262 ###
- Imperfectly.

### Line 2263 ###
Dr. Mann, do not...

### Line 2264 ###
Hatch lockout disengaged.

### Line 2265 ###
Dr. Mann, do not,

### Line 2266 ###
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

### Line 2267 ###
I repeat, do not open the hatch.

### Line 2268 ###
If you open the hatch,

### Line 2269 ###
the airlock will depressurise.

### Line 2270 ###
- What happens if he blows the airlock?

### Line 2271 ###
- Nothing good.

### Line 2272 ###
Okay, pull back. Retro thrusters,

### Line 2273 ###
everything we've got, CASE!

### Line 2274 ###
- Thrusters are full!

### Line 2275 ###
- Back!

### Line 2276 ###
Relay my transmission

### Line 2277 ###
to the on board computer...

### Line 2278 ###
and have it rebroadcast

### Line 2279 ###
as emergency P.A.

### Line 2280 ###
Dr. Mann...

### Line 2281 ###
I repeat, do not open

### Line 2282 ###
the inner hatch. I repeat...

### Line 2283 ###
Brand?

### Line 2284 ###
I don't know what he said to you...

### Line 2285 ###
but I am taking command

### Line 2286 ###
of the Endurance.

### Line 2287 ###
And then we can talk

### Line 2288 ###
about completing the mission.

### Line 2289 ###
Dr. Mann, listen to me.

### Line 2290 ###
This is not about my life.

### Line 2291 ###
Or Cooper's life. This

### Line 2292 ###
is about all mankind.

### Line 2293 ###
There is a moment...

### Line 2294 ###
It is not sa...

### Line 2295 ###
Oh, my God.

### Line 2296 ###
There's no point using fuel to chase...

### Line 2297 ###
- Analyse the Endurance's spin.

### Line 2298 ###
- Cooper, what are you doing?

### Line 2299 ###
- Docking.

### Line 2300 ###
Endurance rotation is 67, 68 RPM.

### Line 2301 ###
Okay, get ready to match our spin

### Line 2302 ###
with the retro thrusters.

### Line 2303 ###
- it's not possible.

### Line 2304 ###
- No...

### Line 2305 ###
it's necessary.

### Line 2306 ###
Endurance is hitting stratosphere!

### Line 2307 ###
She's got no heat shield.

### Line 2308 ###
- CASE, you ready?

### Line 2309 ###
- Ready.

### Line 2310 ###
Cooper! This is no time for caution.

### Line 2311 ###
CASE, if I black out, you take the stick.

### Line 2312 ###
TARS, get ready to engage

### Line 2313 ###
the docking mechanism.

### Line 2314 ###
Endurance is starting to heat.

### Line 2315 ###
Twenty feet out.

### Line 2316 ###
I need three degrees starboard, Cooper.

### Line 2317 ###
Ten feet out.

### Line 2318 ###
Cooper, we are lined up.

### Line 2319 ###
Initiating spin!

### Line 2320 ###
Come on, TARS.

### Line 2321 ###
Come on, TARS!

### Line 2322 ###
- We are locked, Cooper.

### Line 2323 ###
- Locked. Easing up!

### Line 2324 ###
Easy.

### Line 2325 ###
Easy.

### Line 2326 ###
Retro thrusters!

### Line 2327 ###
Main engines on.

### Line 2328 ###
Pushing out of orbit. Come on, baby.

### Line 2329 ###
Killing main engines!

### Line 2330 ###
Okay, we're out of orbit.

### Line 2331 ###
Okay. And for our next trick!

### Line 2332 ###
it'll have to be good.

### Line 2333 ###
We're heading into Gargantua's pull.

### Line 2334 ###
Oh, shit.

### Line 2335 ###
- CASE, take the stick.

### Line 2336 ###
- Roger that.

### Line 2337 ###
Cooper, we're slipping towards Gargantua.

### Line 2338 ###
Shall I use main engines?

### Line 2339 ###
No.

### Line 2340 ###
We got to let her slide as far as we can.

### Line 2341 ###
- Give it to me.

### Line 2342 ###
- There's good news, there's bad news.

### Line 2343 ###
Yeah, I've heard that one, TARS.

### Line 2344 ###
Give it to me straight.

### Line 2345 ###
The backup generator kicked in,

### Line 2346 ###
so the system's stable. They're all good.

### Line 2347 ###
Good.

### Line 2348 ###
Okay. The navigational hub

### Line 2349 ###
has been completely destroyed.

### Line 2350 ###
We don't have enough life support

### Line 2351 ###
to make it back to Earth...

### Line 2352 ###
but we can scratch our way

### Line 2353 ###
to Edmunds' planet.

### Line 2354 ###
What about fuel?

### Line 2355 ###
Not enough. But I have a plan.

### Line 2356 ###
We let Gargantua pull us down

### Line 2357 ###
close to her horizon.

### Line 2358 ###
Then a powered slingshot around,

### Line 2359 ###
launching us towards Edmunds' planet.

### Line 2360 ###
- Manually?

### Line 2361 ###
- That's what I'm here for.

### Line 2362 ###
I'm gonna take us just

### Line 2363 ###
inside the critical orbit.

### Line 2364 ###
- What about time slippage?

### Line 2365 ###
- Neither of us has time to worry...

### Line 2366 ###
about relativity right now, Dr. Brand.

### Line 2367 ###
I'm sorry, Cooper.

### Line 2368 ###
Once we've gathered

### Line 2369 ###
enough speed around Gargantua...

### Line 2370 ###
we use Lander 1...

### Line 2371 ###
and Ranger 2 as rocket boosters to...

### Line 2372 ###
push us out of the black hole's gravity.

### Line 2373 ###
The Lander's linkages

### Line 2374 ###
have been destroyed...

### Line 2375 ###
so we'll have to control manually.

### Line 2376 ###
Once Lander 1 is spent, TARS will detach...

### Line 2377 ###
And get sucked into that black hole.

### Line 2378 ###
Why does TARS have to detach?

### Line 2379 ###
We have to shed the weight

### Line 2380 ###
to escape the gravity.

### Line 2381 ###
Newton's third law.

### Line 2382 ###
The only way humans have ever

### Line 2383 ###
figured out of getting somewhere...

### Line 2384 ###
is to leave something behind.

### Line 2385 ###
Cooper, you can't ask TARS

### Line 2386 ###
to do this for us.

### Line 2387 ###
He's a robot. So you don't have

### Line 2388 ###
to ask him to do anything.

### Line 2389 ###
Cooper, you asshole!

### Line 2390 ###
Sorry, you broke up a little bit there.

### Line 2391 ###
It's what we intended, Dr. Brand.

### Line 2392 ###
It's our only chance to

### Line 2393 ###
save people on Earth.

### Line 2394 ###
If I can find a way to transmit

### Line 2395 ###
the quantum data I'll find in there...

### Line 2396 ###
they might still make it.

### Line 2397 ###
Let's just hope

### Line 2398 ###
there's still someone there to save.

### Line 2399 ###
Maximum velocity achieved.

### Line 2400 ###
Prepare to fire escape thrusters.

### Line 2401 ###
Ready?

### Line 2402 ###
Ready.

### Line 2403 ###
Ready.

### Line 2404 ###
Main engine ignition in three...

### Line 2405 ###
two...

### Line 2406 ###
one. Mark.

### Line 2407 ###
Come on, baby.

### Line 2408 ###
Lander 1 engines, on my mark.

### Line 2409 ###
Three...

### Line 2410 ###
two... one. Mark.

### Line 2411 ###
Ranger 2 engines, on my mark.

### Line 2412 ###
Three, two, one...

### Line 2413 ###
- Mark.

### Line 2414 ###
- Fire!

### Line 2415 ###
This little manoeuvre's

### Line 2416 ###
gonna cost us 51 years!

### Line 2417 ###
You don't sound so bad for pushing 120!

### Line 2418 ###
Lander 1, prepare to detach on my mark.

### Line 2419 ###
Three, two...

### Line 2420 ###
one. Mark.

### Line 2421 ###
Detach!

### Line 2422 ###
- Goodbye, TARS.

### Line 2423 ###
- Goodbye, Dr. Brand.

### Line 2424 ###
- See you on the other side, Coop.

### Line 2425 ###
- See you there, Slick!

### Line 2426 ###
Okay, CASE.

### Line 2427 ###
- Nice reckless flying!

### Line 2428 ###
- Learned from the master.

### Line 2429 ###
- Ranger 2, prepare to detach.

### Line 2430 ###
- What?

### Line 2431 ###
No! No! Cooper! What are you doing?

### Line 2432 ###
Newton's third law.

### Line 2433 ###
You got to leave something behind.

### Line 2434 ###
You told me we had enough resources

### Line 2435 ###
for both of us.

### Line 2436 ###
We agreed, Amelia...

### Line 2437 ###
Don't.

### Line 2438 ###
Detach.

### Line 2439 ###
Okay, I am nosing down.

### Line 2440 ###
Approaching the event horizon.

### Line 2441 ###
Portside, dipping down beneath it...

### Line 2442 ###
to go through it.

### Line 2443 ###
Heading towards blackness.

### Line 2444 ###
I have a visual of the event.

### Line 2445 ###
It's all black.

### Line 2446 ###
TARS, do you read me?

### Line 2447 ###
It's all blackness.

### Line 2448 ###
TARS! Do you read me? Over.

### Line 2449 ###
Okay.

### Line 2450 ###
Screens...

### Line 2451 ###
getting interference.

### Line 2452 ###
Losing control of the stick. I got flashes.

### Line 2453 ###
Flashes of lightness and blackness.

### Line 2454 ###
The turbulence in the

### Line 2455 ###
gravity is increasing.

### Line 2456 ###
Ah.

### Line 2457 ###
The computers are going down. Agh.

### Line 2458 ###
Gravitational pull.

### Line 2459 ###
I'm losing control of the stick.

### Line 2460 ###
Murph? Murph, come on!

### Line 2461 ###
Eject. Eject.

### Line 2462 ###
Eject.

### Line 2463 ###
Eject.

### Line 2464 ###
Eject.

### Line 2465 ###
Eject.

### Line 2466 ###
Murph.

### Line 2467 ###
Murph! Murph! Murph!

### Line 2468 ###
Murph!

### Line 2469 ###
No, no, no!

### Line 2470 ###
Murph!

### Line 2471 ###
Murph!

### Line 2472 ###
No! No!

### Line 2473 ###
If you're leaving, just go.

### Line 2474 ###
No, no. No.

### Line 2475 ###
No, don't go. Don't go, you idiot.

### Line 2476 ###
Don't go!

### Line 2477 ###
Morse. Morse.

### Line 2478 ###
Morse.

### Line 2479 ###
Dot. Dot.

### Line 2480 ###
S.

### Line 2481 ###
T.

### Line 2482 ###
A.

### Line 2483 ###
Dash!

### Line 2484 ###
Dash! Dash!

### Line 2485 ###
Murph!

### Line 2486 ###
Murph, we don't have time for this!

### Line 2487 ###
Come on!

### Line 2488 ###
Y.

### Line 2489 ###
"Stay!"

### Line 2490 ###
Come on. Come on, Murph. Come on!

### Line 2491 ###
What's it say? What's it say, Murph?

### Line 2492 ###
What's it say?

### Line 2493 ###
"Stay."

### Line 2494 ###
Tell him, Murph.

### Line 2495 ###
Make him stay.

### Line 2496 ###
Make him stay, Murph.

### Line 2497 ###
Make him stay, Murph.

### Line 2498 ###
Don't let me leave, Murph!

### Line 2499 ###
Don't let me leave, Murph!

### Line 2500 ###
No! No! No!

### Line 2501 ###
It was you.

### Line 2502 ###
You were my ghost.

### Line 2503 ###
Cooper. Cooper. Come in, Cooper.

### Line 2504 ###
- TARS?

### Line 2505 ###
- Roger that.

### Line 2506 ###
- You survived.

### Line 2507 ###
- Somewhere...

### Line 2508 ###
in their fifth dimension.

### Line 2509 ###
They saved us.

### Line 2510 ###
Yeah? Who the hell is "they"?

### Line 2511 ###
And just why would they want to help us?

### Line 2512 ###
I don't know, but they constructed

### Line 2513 ###
this three-dimensional space...

### Line 2514 ###
inside their five-dimensional reality

### Line 2515 ###
to allow you to understand it.

### Line 2516 ###
Yeah, that ain't working.

### Line 2517 ###
Yes, it is.

### Line 2518 ###
You've seen that time is represented here

### Line 2519 ###
as a physical dimension.

### Line 2520 ###
You have worked out that you can exert

### Line 2521 ###
a force across space-time.

### Line 2522 ###
Gravity to send a message.

### Line 2523 ###
Affirmative.

### Line 2524 ###
Gravity...

### Line 2525 ###
can cross the dimensions,

### Line 2526 ###
including time.

### Line 2527 ###
Apparently.

### Line 2528 ###
Do you have the quantum data?

### Line 2529 ###
Roger. I have it.

### Line 2530 ###
I am transmitting it on all wavelengths,

### Line 2531 ###
but nothing is getting out, Cooper.

### Line 2532 ###
I can do this. I can do this.

### Line 2533 ###
But such complicated data to a child?

### Line 2534 ###
Not just any child.

### Line 2535 ###
What else?

### Line 2536 ###
Oh, come on, Dad.

### Line 2537 ###
Murph, the fire's out! Come on!

### Line 2538 ###
Even if you communicate it here, she won't

### Line 2539 ###
understand its significance for years.

### Line 2540 ###
I get that, TARS.

### Line 2541 ###
But we've got to figure something out or

### Line 2542 ###
the people on Earth are gonna die. Think!

### Line 2543 ###
Cooper...

### Line 2544 ###
they didn't bring us here

### Line 2545 ###
to change the past.

### Line 2546 ###
Say that again.

### Line 2547 ###
They didn't bring us

### Line 2548 ###
here to change the past.

### Line 2549 ###
No, they didn't bring us here at all.

### Line 2550 ###
We brought ourselves.

### Line 2551 ###
TARS, give me the coordinates

### Line 2552 ###
for NASA in binary.

### Line 2553 ###
In binary. Roger. Feeding data.

### Line 2554 ###
"It's not a ghost."

### Line 2555 ###
"it's gravity."

### Line 2556 ###
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

### Line 2557 ###
I brought myself here!

### Line 2558 ###
We're here to communicate

### Line 2559 ###
with the three-dimensional world.

### Line 2560 ###
We're the bridge!

### Line 2561 ###
I thought they chose me.

### Line 2562 ###
- But they didn't choose me, they chose her.

### Line 2563 ###
For what, Cooper?

### Line 2564 ###
To save the world.

### Line 2565 ###
All of this is one little girl's bedroom.

### Line 2566 ###
Every moment.

### Line 2567 ###
It's infinitely complex.

### Line 2568 ###
They have access to infinite time and

### Line 2569 ###
space, but they're not bound by anything!

### Line 2570 ###
They can't find a specific place in time.

### Line 2571 ###
They can't communicate.

### Line 2572 ###
That's why I'm here.

### Line 2573 ###
I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph...

### Line 2574 ###
just like I found this moment.

### Line 2575 ###
- How, Cooper?

### Line 2576 ###
- Love, TARS, love.

### Line 2577 ###
It's just like Brand said.

### Line 2578 ###
My connection with

### Line 2579 ###
Murph, it is quantifiable.

### Line 2580 ###
it's the key!

### Line 2581 ###
What are we here to do?

### Line 2582 ###
Find how to tell her.

### Line 2583 ###
The watch.

### Line 2584 ###
The watch.

### Line 2585 ###
That's it.

### Line 2586 ###
We code the data into the movement

### Line 2587 ###
of the second hand.

### Line 2588 ###
TARS, translate the data into Morse

### Line 2589 ###
and feed it to me.

### Line 2590 ###
Translating data to Morse.

### Line 2591 ###
Cooper, what if she never came back for it?

### Line 2592 ###
She will. She will.

### Line 2593 ###
Murph, I can see his car!

### Line 2594 ###
He's coming, Murph!

### Line 2595 ###
Okay. I'm coming down.

### Line 2596 ###
How do you know?

### Line 2597 ###
Because I gave it to her.

### Line 2598 ###
Roger. Morse is dot-dot-dash-dot.

### Line 2599 ###
Dot-dot...

### Line 2600 ###
dash-dot.

### Line 2601 ###
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

### Line 2602 ###
Dot-dash-dot-dot.

### Line 2603 ###
Dash-dash-dash.

### Line 2604 ###
Dash, dash, dash.

### Line 2605 ###
He came back!

### Line 2606 ###
It was him all the time!

### Line 2607 ###
I didn't know. it was him!

### Line 2608 ###
Dad's gonna save us.

### Line 2609 ###
Eureka!

### Line 2610 ###
It's traditional.

### Line 2611 ###
Eureka!

### Line 2612 ###
Did it work?

### Line 2613 ###
I think it might have.

### Line 2614 ###
How do you know?

### Line 2615 ###
Because the bulk beings

### Line 2616 ###
are closing the tesseract.

### Line 2617 ###
Don't you get it yet, TARS?

### Line 2618 ###
They're not "beings."

### Line 2619 ###
They're us.

### Line 2620 ###
What I've been doing for Murph,

### Line 2621 ###
they're doing for me.

### Line 2622 ###
For all of us.

### Line 2623 ###
Cooper, people couldn't build this.

### Line 2624 ###
No. No, not yet.

### Line 2625 ###
But one day.

### Line 2626 ###
Not you and me. But people.

### Line 2627 ###
A civilisation that's evolved past

### Line 2628 ###
the four dimensions we know.

### Line 2629 ###
What happens now?

### Line 2630 ###
Mr. Cooper.

### Line 2631 ###
All right. Let's take it slow, sir.

### Line 2632 ###
Nice and easy, Mr. Cooper.

### Line 2633 ###
Remember, you're no spring chicken anymore.

### Line 2634 ###
Actually, you are 124 years old.

### Line 2635 ###
Take it slow, sir.

### Line 2636 ###
You were, uh, extremely lucky.

### Line 2637 ###
The Rangers found you with only minutes

### Line 2638 ###
left in your oxygen supply.

### Line 2639 ###
Where am I?

### Line 2640 ###
Cooper Station.

### Line 2641 ###
Currently orbiting Saturn.

### Line 2642 ###
Cooper Station.

### Line 2643 ###
Nice of you to name it after me.

### Line 2644 ###
What?

### Line 2645 ###
The station isn't named after you, sir.

### Line 2646 ###
It's, uh, named after your daughter.

### Line 2647 ###
Although she's always maintained

### Line 2648 ###
just how important you were.

### Line 2649 ###
Is she still alive?

### Line 2650 ###
She'll be here in a couple weeks.

### Line 2651 ###
She is far too old to be transferring

### Line 2652 ###
from another station...

### Line 2653 ###
but when she heard

### Line 2654 ###
that you'd been found...

### Line 2655 ###
well, this is, uh, Murphy Cooper

### Line 2656 ###
we're talking about.

### Line 2657 ###
Yes, it is.

### Line 2658 ###
We'll have you checked out of here

### Line 2659 ###
in a couple days.

### Line 2660 ###
I'm sure you'll be excited to see

### Line 2661 ###
what's in store.

### Line 2662 ###
I actually, uh, did a paper on you

### Line 2663 ###
in high school.

### Line 2664 ###
I know all about your life back on Earth.

### Line 2665 ###
Oh, yeah.

### Line 2666 ###
Right.

### Line 2667 ###
If... If you'll follow me,

### Line 2668 ###
we've got a really good situation for you.

### Line 2669 ###
So, uh, when I made my suggestion

### Line 2670 ###
to Miss Cooper...

### Line 2671 ###
I was delighted to hear

### Line 2672 ###
that she thought it was perfect.

### Line 2673 ###
It was just constant.

### Line 2674 ###
Just that steady blow of dirt.

### Line 2675 ###
Of course, I didn't speak

### Line 2676 ###
to her personally.

### Line 2677 ###
We always set the plate upside-down.

### Line 2678 ###
Glasses or cups,

### Line 2679 ###
whatever it was, upside-down.

### Line 2680 ###
Well, my dad was a farmer.

### Line 2681 ###
Uh, like everybody else back then.

### Line 2682 ###
There just wasn't enough food.

### Line 2683 ###
We wore little things, little strips...

### Line 2684 ###
of sheet over our nose and mouth

### Line 2685 ###
so we wouldn't breathe so much of it.

### Line 2686 ###
Well, it was pretty exciting for me

### Line 2687 ###
because it was hope.

### Line 2688 ###
I don't care who describes

### Line 2689 ###
it, there is no way

### Line 2690 ###
for it to be exaggerated.

### Line 2691 ###
It was that bad.

### Line 2692 ###
She did confirm

### Line 2693 ###
just how much you loved farming.

### Line 2694 ###
- Oh, she did, did she?

### Line 2695 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 2696 ###
Come here.

### Line 2697 ###
Home sweet home. Everything

### Line 2698 ###
replaced and put back where it...

### Line 2699 ###
- Hey, is this...?

### Line 2700 ###
- Oh, yeah.

### Line 2701 ###
The machine we found out near Saturn

### Line 2702 ###
when we found you. Yes.

### Line 2703 ###
Its, uh, power source was shot,

### Line 2704 ###
but we could get you another one.

### Line 2705 ###
Yes. Please.

### Line 2706 ###
Settings.

### Line 2707 ###
General settings.

### Line 2708 ###
Security settings.

### Line 2709 ###
Honesty, new setting:

### Line 2710 ###
Confirmed. Additional customisation?

### Line 2711 ###
Humour:

### Line 2712 ###
Confirmed.

### Line 2713 ###
Auto self-destruct T-minus 10, nine...

### Line 2714 ###
Let's make that 60 percent.

### Line 2715 ###
Sixty percent confirmed.

### Line 2716 ###
- Knock-knock.

### Line 2717 ###
- You want 55?

### Line 2718 ###
Is this really what it was like?

### Line 2719 ###
It was never this clean, Slick. Heh.

### Line 2720 ###
I don't care much for this pretending

### Line 2721 ###
we're back where we started.

### Line 2722 ###
I want to know where we are.

### Line 2723 ###
Where we're going.

### Line 2724 ###
- Mr. Cooper. The family's all in there.

### Line 2725 ###
- Yeah.

### Line 2726 ###
Family?

### Line 2727 ###
Yeah, they all came out to see her. She's

### Line 2728 ###
been in cryo-sleep for almost two years.

### Line 2729 ###
You told them I like farming.

### Line 2730 ###
It was me, Murph.

### Line 2731 ###
I was your ghost.

### Line 2732 ###
I know.

### Line 2733 ###
People didn't believe me. They thought

### Line 2734 ###
that I was doing it all myself.

### Line 2735 ###
But...

### Line 2736 ###
I knew who it was.

### Line 2737 ###
Nobody believed me.

### Line 2738 ###
But I knew you'd come back.

### Line 2739 ###
How?

### Line 2740 ###
Because my dad promised me.

### Line 2741 ###
Well, I'm here now, Murph.

### Line 2742 ###
I'm here.

### Line 2743 ###
No.

### Line 2744 ###
No parent should have to watch

### Line 2745 ###
their own child die.

### Line 2746 ###
I have my kids here for me now.

### Line 2747 ###
You go.

### Line 2748 ###
Where?

### Line 2749 ###
Brand.

### Line 2750 ###
She's out there...

### Line 2751 ###
setting up camp.

### Line 2752 ###
Alone...

### Line 2753 ###
in a strange galaxy.

### Line 2754 ###
Maybe right now

### Line 2755 ###
she's settling in for the long nap...

### Line 2756 ###
by the light of our new sun...

### Line 2757 ###
in our new home.
